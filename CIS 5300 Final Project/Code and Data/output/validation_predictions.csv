"Her turquoise lips kiss me like a lover. Her silver eyes see right through my veins. Her Indian heart asks when I'll return to her. Her Spanish soul begs me to remain. And no one that I've ever known can move me like she does. No, it's not a woman that I love. Santa Fe Santa Fe. I have been here in your arms and now I want to stay. Santa Fe Santa Fe. I won't sleep 'till I'm back in Santa Fe. Her sunrise could bring light into a blind man. Her sunset could put tears there in his eyes. Her colors are laying there in brush strokes. Underneath those peote skies. The lay of the land stirs all of my emotions. She heals me with a laid back energy. She holds onto my broken lifeless spirit. And molds me just like pottery. And nowhere that I've ever been can make me feel this way. That's why I'm going there to stay.",Country,Indie

"Open your eyes, and we confront the misery
Listen to what I say, just latch onto the words forever
Who are you fighting for?
Who are you fighting for?
And now I've got to find a simple escape

All I need, all I need is a simple escape
Can't you see my mind as it struggles to be sane
An escape from everything, oh
It finally changes on the inside, oh

Why do we forget, all the things that don't matter?
Listen to what I say, just latch onto the words forever
What are we fighting for?
What are we fighting for?
And now I've got to find a simple escape

All I need, all I need is a simple escape
Can't you see my mind as it struggles to be sane
An escape from everything, oh
It finally changes on the inside, oh

Don't hold your breath for the things that you seek
It will all burn to the ground with everything
We're all looking for our freedom
From the things we want to run from.

All I need, all I need is a simple escape
Can't you see my mind as it struggles to be sane
An escape from everything, oh
It finally changes on the inside, oh
Open your eyes!",Electronic,Electronic
"I can love you in the morning
I can love you all day
I can love you even more when I get home
I can love you every second
To the ends of the earth
Where needing you's the only thing that's on
My broken one track mind

Girl, I love you crazy
It comes so easy, after all we had
I could love you with all my heart
But the hardest part is
I just can't love you back

I could write a thousand letters
Call a hundred times a day
Or try to drown my sorrow at the bar
I could go down to the church
Get on my knees and pray
But it still won't change the way things really are
Won't bring you back again

Girl, I love you crazy
It comes so easy, after all we had
I could love you with all my heart
But the hardest part is
I just can't love you back

I can love you for all I'm worth
To the ends of the earth
But I just can't love you back",Rock,R&B

his light was so bright that they turned away
and he stood alone
every night and every day
then he turned to me
he saw his reflection in me
and he smiled at me when he turned to me
then he said to me
how good it is
how good it is
how good it is
how good it is
i'm an orange moon
i'm brighter than before
brighter than ever before
i'm an orange moon and i shine so bright
cause i reflect the light of my sun
i praise the day
he turned my way
and smiled at me
he gets to smile and i get to be orange
that i love to be

"I've been a fool
I tripped and fell, there was nothing I could do
Forgot what I had, thought I had something to prove
Oh what a fool
I couldn't change
Put my hand into flame
That was the only way I ever see some light come back again

If it's love if it's hate give me more
I can take what you're feeling
Oh what you're feeling
Let me say it all over again
Give me fire give me rain
I can take all the pain if I hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you
Just wanna say it all over again
Oh now
I think about the nights I let you down
I remember all the times you helped me out
I'm sorry now
You're slipping away
? ?
All I want to do is fix it up
And hope it's not too late
Whatever you got for me
If it's love if it's hate give me more
I can take what you're feeling

Let me say it all over again
Give me fire give me rain
I can take all the pain if I hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you

"Willin' to start again
Willin' to give another try
Willin' to pretend

Willin' to comprehend
Willin' to give up on my pride

The quicker that they subside

I love to let you... down

Willin' to step back in the light
Willin' to forget

Willin' to turn my head
Willin' to let my feelings slide
Willin' to befriend

"We are words that float through her veins
Her sexual use of pain
And she sends her sailors in
Well, they don't come back
And they don't give in

We are sailors drunk as wine
They forget the house in time

Tied in the arms of an octopus

Winds come trolling, the sea don't care
National anthem of nowhere
Winds come trolling, the sea don't care

[?] but cannot save
From across the waves
With a knife that's sure to kill
Following herself
Suits the dollar [?]

Darling, watch the sunrise

Where niggaz claim to done, where they from and who run shit
I bang it to the tip-top
Can't stop, won't stop, droppin gangbang hit rocks
To the last drip-drop
To the, tick tock to the blocks niggaz rip glocks
I'm knowin that this shit hot
This your first introduction to this motherfuckin crip hop

It's time to research the documents and pull some files
and put it down with this gangsta style
Cause I be seein niggaz bein more aggressive now
after peace treaty meetings and the weapons down
Sport Chucks 'member once it was Nikes and sandals
To me it's unlikely that you're sheisty and skanless
To manage this dramaticness I call my rep
Every step stay on deck keepin bustaz in check
Certified murder guide through the streets of death
Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met
From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash
Niggaz have done did when the steel'll blast
Pockets filled with cash, fuck a Benz or Jag
Lookin rough in a bucket, tuckin tens and Macs
Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock
Lick shots and the cops and control your block
Keep it true with the crew from the old to new
Ride providin 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do
Notice who, participatin all the activity
That's how we livin G, strictly killer tendencies
So death to all my enemies
And to the homies who rest in peace, a dub bag and Hennessy
These weak niggaz killin me
with their proclivity to even proclimate that they as real as me

"Burning out in the distance you're falling
Starting to fade
Light is condemned to be tied down by gravity close to the end
Do you still remember?
Before the weight that pulled you under
Dared you to rise
Where are you now?
Are you proud of the life you wasted?
Wearing the crown of illusion you created
You'll never know what it feels like to shine
You're the master in your own mind
But a slave to all
You are a dark star
Empty
Is never enough
You keep clawing for what you can't reach
Smothering space filled without any grace and I can't breathe
Nothing lasts forever
Even the stars will loose their luster returning to dust
Where are you now?
Are you proud of the life you wasted?
Wearing the crown of illusion you created
You'll never know what it feels like to shine

"i was unafraid
i was a boy
i was a tender age
melic in the naked
knew a lake and drew the lofts for page
hurdle all the waitings up
know it wasn't wedded love
4 long minutes end and it was over it'd all be back
and the frost took up the eyes
pressed against the pane could see the veins and there was poison out
resting in a raze the inner claims i hadn't breadth to shake
searching for an inner clout
may not take another bout
honey in the hale could fill the pales of loving less with vain
hon
it wasn't yet the spring
aiming and it sunk and we were drunk and we had fleshed it out
nose up in the globes
you never know if you are passing out
no it wasn't maiden-up
the falling or the faded luck
hung up in the ivory
both were climbing for a finer cause
love can hardly leave the room
with your heart",Indie,Folk

"It's been a long, long year
But it's flown on by
There's a story told
Of a miracle kind

You're my miracle
In the midst of it all
You hold me here

And I know the reason
Each glowing candle shines
No matter what the season
It's always Christmas time
Knowing that you're mine

Girl, we use to share
The whole world doesn't have
Someone like you
Calling out their name

It's like a church bell ring
It's like a prayer you sing
It's like a dream you dream
It's finally happening

And I know the reason
Each glowing candle shines
No matter what the season
It's always Christmas time
Knowing that you're mine

Silver snow fills the air
People start to share joy and hope
Peace and love
Shower from above

And I know the reason
Each glowing candle shines
No matter what the season
It's always Christmas time
Knowing that you're mine

It's been a long, long year
It's coming to an end
Looking by my side
You still have my faith",Folk,Country

English lyrics (1940) by Albert Gamse Amapola, my pretty little poppy, You're like the lovely flower so sweet and heavenly.

"There was a man came to see the USA from a foreign land
To photograph the progress of dear old Uncle Sam
He got off the boat in New York went down to the Bowery
I know what the man went to photograph and to see

There were hopeless hungry living dead
Winos who sell their souls for a bottle of a cheapest red
That's the picture that he wanted 
And that's what he got they say America the ugly today

He went to the Appalachians and he saw what we all have seen
Where people live on bread and soup fat back and pinto beans
He saw the hungry children and he photographed the ragged clothes
I guess we're gonna try to tell him that it ain't so

There were good men standin' around with nothing to do
Pregnant young women who didn't even have a pair of shoes
The man got his pictures and what are we going to say America the ugly today

Then he went to the medicare centers and he saw the old people there
It seems that the young generation just didn't want 'em in their hair
He saw the poor man workin' it out while the mighty rich lives high
And my friend that brings a gleam to the enemy's eyes

There were some folks had plenty and some had none at all
The enemy knows when a heart gets hard the country is bound to fall
If we get heads and hearts together we won't have to hear them say
America the ugly today America the ugly today",Folk,Folk

"Well, we'd all head to Waco, for the birth of our Lord
My folks and my brother in an '82 Ford
We'd pull in the driveway filled up with cars
Old aunts and old uncles, Lord I see stars
And then we'd run to the kitchen, you know kids and their games
Play fetch with old Buster, call each other names
Aunt Betty'd be singing while supper was cooking
We'd unwrap the gifts when no one was lookin'

Let's all gather 'round, Grandpa say the blessing
Aunt Jane, she fell asleep, Mary Kay burned the dressing
But we got all of our friends and family here
And I'm grateful for Christmas this year

Well, this year, we're in Houston, let's all get together
Man, I almost saw snow, can you believe this weather?
Who's gonna be here? Uncle Frank can't make it
Since Grandpa died, I don't know if Nana can take it
Well, this present's a sweater and the pie don't taste right
And Dad, and the TV, are startin' to fight
I wish I had a drink or maybe a dozen
Lord, what I'd give for one good lookin' cousin

So let's all gather 'round, Dad you say the blessing
Aunt Jane, she fell asleep, and Mary Kay forgot the dressing
But we got all of our friends and family here
And I'm grateful for Christmas this year

Hey Mom, how you doing? Yeah, I miss him too
Nah, the Christmas lights don't make your hair look blue
The cousins ain't coming and Jon's overseas
And I guess my wife loves her folks more than me
But the ladies from the church said, they might stop by
I brought you this picture, ahh, mama don't cry
Let's play cards and watch the news channel
I love you too, and thanks for the flannel

So let's all gather 'round, I guess I'll say the blessing
Aunt Jane, she fell asleep, and I never cared for dressing
But we got all of our friends and family here
And I'm grateful for Christmas this year
Oh, I'm grateful for Christmas this year",Folk,Country
"You thought you had it all
Until you found all you'd lost. 
You thought you knew it all.
Then you learned something new. 

You once stood tall. 
You once stood proud. 
Look at you now;
Just another face in the crowd. 

I didn't ruin you. 
Your own arrogance was your downfall. 
I'll shed no tears for you. 
I'm glad to see you crawl. 

I knew what you would say about me, 
So I grew a thick skin you couldn't see right through. 
Yours aren't words to extol, 
So fuck you. 
I'm not yours to control. 

When you have to face me, you're never as bold. 
Now you berate me. 
Now I can be controlled.",Metal,Metal
"In the misty morning after darkest night,
I feel the heat, I do, and I remember,
Promises are broken now you're gone.
Don't turn me down,
I'm lost and I surrender...

Give me just a sign,
Help to cross the line,
We'll back time and starts again.

Far away - I can you're callin',
Far away - callin' up my name.
Far away - and the tears are fallin',
Far away - no one is to blame...

Some feelings won't come easy,
You have to hit them hard.
You've burned the bridge,
And I fell in a sea of sorrow.
Can you hear my prayer,
Just bring back yesterday,
I feel the pain, it makes me hate tomorrow...

Take me for a while,
Just to make me smile.
I wish I'll never ever cry again.

Far away - I can hear you're callin',
Far away - callin' up my name.
Far away - and the tears are fallin',
Far away - no one is to blame...",Metal,Rock

"A little girl dreamer
Ribbons and long curls
Reflections of yesterdays past
Headlines and footlights
Wee hours and long nights
Keep everything moving so fast

It's taken a long time
And she's walked a fine line
For fortune and fame have arrived
She kept on striving
And half-way surviving
Till part of those dreams came alive

[Chorus:]
Now she wishes she looked like they tell her she looks all the time
What she'd give just to feel like she tells them she's feelin' just fine
All that money she makes every night ain't as much as it seems
Cause it's a dollar a wrinkle and less than a nickel a dream

Well, her heart may be breaking
But she keeps on taking what she thought she wanted back then
It's too late to change her,
There's always a stranger to tell her she's someone again

She's waiting on another man, I've no drink again. 
She flashed me the menu, working smile on her lips. 
Led me just enough. I shouldn't have tipped.

The other one there, I didn't give two glances. 
She's in love with my soul, she thinks I'm attractive.

"Okay, I hopped up out of bed and yep, I turned my swag on
Little kids playing outside, getting their laugh on
I woke up from the noise, and I couldn't be mad
I've been gone for a minute, it's so good to be back
But it's time to relapse
Fell back into the rhythm of the ??
of livin and these skills I've been given
Never thought I'd make a living off this timin and precision
Got some rhymes hot enough to get a baker out the kitchen
Okay life is what you make it
And I'll take it if you give it
And I got these critics living
I surpassed all their limits
I mastered the craft in the lab like a chemist
Triple bypass on a track, call a medic
It's a nice warm day, water with some lemon
Got me wonder why I am thinking bout this music stressin
Wonder why I am even second guessing
it's a blessin just to be here
Specially when there's weed here
Hah, roll up
All I have fore you cut me down
All I have fore you cut me down
D-d-d-down
Now you can cut me down
But Imma bounce back like I must rebound
Turn a beat into a luxury how
After this Imma make sure you love me now
Imma keep on flowin till you bump my shit
Tell creative lovin they can suck my dick
Little faggots aint doin nothin but bumpin lifts
Give it a year, man, you bustas gon be bustin dishes
I'm a problem
Let em hate on me like it's an option
I bet they gon regret that decision up in the long run
They dont see my vision, man they trippin like they on some
Pretty sure their girls gon be fans when the song's done
Love it how I'm so hip hop in flip flops
Flows so tip top
Haters can lip lock
Barrel of a gun, kill yourself man, kick rocks
Right off a cliff, shit go head man get a walk
I'm tryin to keep a sucka-free zone this year
Steer clear from all these fuckers and these clones out here
So cheer cheer man these poems that I loan your ears
Are nothin more than my thoughts and my soul to bear
They cut me down
All I have fore you cut me down
All I have fore you cut me down
D-d-d-down
Now you can cut me down
But Imma bounce back like I must rebound
Turn a beat into a luxury how
After this Imma make sure you love me now
I spend a lot of time drinkin
A lot of time thinkin
Bout advice dudes give me but none of it seems to sink in
People really my friends, or tryin to benefit?
Either way, nowadays it's gettin harder to distinguish
I pay attention to some people I don't know
I got a small circle that I'm tryin to keep closed
Couple enemies that I'm tryin to keep close
They still irkin, but can't you see I'm workin?
Relentless persistence infectin the system
They can't get rid of me, I'm hittin like a kick drum
Aint tryin to socialize, workin on a thick buzz
Give me a coke on the rocks and some mixed rum
G-gawkin, starrin like a comet in the clouds

On the same old tears I've tasted
Time and time and time again
Oh when will this cycle end
It's all part of the story
All the misery and glory
All the enemies and friends
And those with us until the end
Here's to the secrets we can't keep
Here's to the words we cannot speak
Here's to the nights that we forget
So beautifully tragic
Here's to all those who wish us well
And to the rest who can go to hell
Here's to the memories that make me fucking sick
Beautifully tragic
All of the moments are spending in time
We wish we could relive, rewind
The clock and let me live it up again
(Live it up again!)
There is no pause are we living in time
Not realizing what's passing by
I'll take what we share to the end

"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",R&B,Folk
"Summer journeys
To Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares

I've a cozy little flat
In what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Jazz,Jazz

"All my senses rebel
Under the scrutiny of their persistent gaze.
It took a lifetime to get here,
A journey I'll never make again.

For those who have accepted the burden of shame.
For the innocent only guilt will remain
And our lives will be forced to accommodate
The perpetrators of our own bastard race.

All my senses rebel
Under the scrutiny of their persistent gaze.
It took a lifetime to get here,
A journey I'll never make again.

I stand accused of a thousand and one crimes.
A witness to events that led up to this present time.
These traditions, which bind our hands and keep us tied,
Will never survive the greater test of time.

Deliver me from these feverish eyes
That threaten to unbalance my state of mind.
For I must confess only to the smallest of crimes.
A sense of guilt.",Folk,Metal

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

"All of a sudden now you're back again
I thought you were happy with whoever or did you dream about me now and then
Did you look up at the stars and feel something for the constellations
All those lovers circling round their loves
Slings and arrows, dogs and lions, rivers separating touch from touch
The comedy of distance, the tragedy of separation

Am I making all the right moves
Am I singing you the right blues
Is there a chance that I could call you
Just to see how you are doing?

I said how is it that you come back to me?
You don't need the stories of my scars or in the stars to tell you nothing's free
I traded all the innocence I ever had for hesitation
I said won't you tell me where you been?
You put a finger to my lips and then you kissed me once and once again
The crickets all leapt up and met the moon with a standing ovation

Am I making all the right moves
Am I singing you the right blues
Is there a chance that I could call you
Just to see how you are doing?

I heard the night birds picking up the song
You threw your hair back and sang along
And I realized that I might lose you you might lose me
Drift apart in the night and never know why and not know how I said
what if we are like the Northern sky?
What if there are things that come between us that we can't take back and we can't make right?
You said I don't know darlin' but I'm here with you
And we're coming to the chorus now!

Am I making all the right moves
Am I singing you the right blues
Is there a chance that I could call you
Just to see how you are doing?",Folk,Country

"Is it true that I've lost you

Am I not the only one
After all this pain and sorrow
Darling think of what you've done

Heart to heart dear how I need you
Like the flowers need the dew
Loving you has been my life, dear
I can't believe we're really through
I'll go back to old Virginia
Where the mountains meet the sky
In those hills I learned to love you
Let me stay there till I die",Folk,Country
"[VERSE 1:]
Babe boy you must got nicki twisted
I would've left before but you insisted
Said that I was your all and I believed you
That's why it hurts to the core I gotta leave you
How could you love me and humiliate me
You ain't my man don't affiliate me
With all your plans cause you really made me
A lil bitch when that really ain't me
Mondays was the fun days
From the slum to the runway
Runs in the hyundai
Niggas didn't have your money it was gun play
Used to tell me to listen to what a thug say
At night I would sleep on you
And I guess I did sleep on you
Cause when they said it I said creep on who
No not my boo
Ain't what he gon do
[CHORUS:]
Oh now you wanna be with me
But you can't be with me
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life
You shoulda treated me right
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
[VERSE 2:]
Why you saying you ain't feel her
You was in the villa
She was in the white chinchilla
You was sippin on a miller
My bitch pam had the hidden cam like killa
Funny how ya win some
Ya lose some
Never worry where your income would come from
Cause no matter where you was I held you down
Up north to uptown
So how you sound
Now you all up in my face bout you make mistakes
If I'da known you was fake I'da laced your steak
Strick nine one time in your welchs grape
Quit lying
Why you lying
I watched the tape
Now get up out my dressing room
Give me some f'ing room
Go get your mind right and take it as a lesson learned
Just like usher nigga you gon have to let it burn
To the left and I ain't talkin about jigga girl

Oh now you wanna be with me

i'm all hot and all bothered it's
too late for talk
maybe we should sleep it off
but you wanna pick
you're gonna throw 'til it sticks
put me in my place
what'd i do now
maybe you oughta count
to 10
just wait it out
cause you might say something you'll regret
and even if you say that you're sorry
i won't forget
even though you didn't mean it
you can't take it back
can't take it back
can't take it back
i feel like dirt
it's 6 am and i haven't slept
i been up all night
in another endless fight
cause you wanna poke
you gonna turn every stone
see what it reveals
it's too much of a struggle
i've seen way to much ugliness
to feel love anymore
and you keep saying things you'll regret
when all your feelings are burning
you make sure that i'm hurtling too
and you just say that you're sorry
and i
i take you back
i take you back
i take you back
everything started so innocently
you were so gentle
so sweet
and i can't be perfect
and i can't be your girlfriend
if you can't accept me
and if you're not happy
maybe it's not meant to be

"We spun from the ceiling
On the floor we found a startling view
There's no door that's good for leaving
And the walls will crush me right back into you

You're such a lovely mess
Hearts have left a wreck
It's beautiful I guess

Grey songs in the morning
Sadder still in the afternoon
I gave back the bed in silence
The longest day is ending soon

You're such a lovely mess
Hearts have left a wreck
It's beautiful I guess

Most of the time, we sing our happy songs
Both of us tried to sing each other's songs

So long to the distance
Farewell to the walls we stumbled through and through
And that door that's good for leaving
The heart has walls that are hard and true

You're such a lovely mess
Hearts have left a wreck
I'm lonely I confess
It's beautiful I guess",Folk,Country

"The ashen grey muse commissions a new verse
A song to while away the long sojourn in the hearse
Yet all of us who danse macabre to these dour, dismal tunes
Become cold, grim and hard as the dirt upon the tomb
In darkened dirges death's knell peals out it's toll
As another cadaver is consigned six feet down to its hole
But ere the last shovel of dirt falls on the wall of the box
We gravely offer a salute to those about to rot
So lift up your severed heads, in a song for the dead
Life's course ever runs red, so let no lyric remain unsaid
As from our mouths the melody is bled, in a symphony scripted in red
Like rats by the piper we're led, to join in this song for the dead

The humor of the gallons never fails to ring true
In this dead, bleak, sick world that we're hung, drawn and quartered though
As each internecine instrument plays its own bloody part
The hammering of coffin nails outpaces the beating of our hearts
Symphonic surgery orchestrated, a cleaver conducts
The execrable epiphany comes too late, just to reduce us to chunks
Rising up from the sod heaves a gross, putrid breath
As the chorus is joined in this song for the dead
So lift up your severed heads, in a song for the dead
Life's course ever runs red, so let no lyric remain unsaid
As from our mouths the melody is bled, in a symphony scripted in red
Like rats by the piper we're led, to join in this song for the dead

Truncated toccatas deranged, raked across barbed strings and hacked
Eviscerated etudes for the de-brained, plucked upon heartstring stretched
On the rack
Medicinal movements decomposed
Regurgitating oratorios obscene
Forensic fugues and de-boned
Mutilating the melody's method and means
The crepitated coda dies in mid-refrain
As the sheet-music is obscured by a sanguine scarlet stain
Shattered stave lodged in your split-open splattered brain
The ruptured meter falters as the bow is fretted once again
Acrid arias are screeched
The bloated thorax is breached
Abrading viscera with bleach
Grotesquely gavage the deceased

Cleaving the clef
Broken notes bleed into a mess
Falling on ears so deaf
So it ever is in death
Carbonized cantatas corrupt, ringing out, sewing seeds of dischord and
Dismay
Suppurated sonatas erupt, Purulent pizzicatos slicing every which way
The truncated cadence is sundered, Bloody scraps of sheet music
Unintellibly scrawled
Threnodies resonate six feet under, To where all life's fractured melodies
Will finally resolve
The symphonic slaughter's swells without restraint
As the cacophonous cadenza splits your eardrums clean in twain
The repugnant orchestra pit an abattoir of death and pain
The hatchet falls in sharp staccato until everyone is slain",Metal,Metal

You said you lived alone

So I asume he was your lover 
Tell me what should I think about you

I respected you enough 
Tell me what the deal

Said you called but I couldn't see

You said your wheels are cut

Took my love 
And you thode it own out

And did my best to make you happy
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby

There was a night when you held me tight
And you said you'd always love me
You said you'd never hurt me

What will there be left for me
It's such a cruel world to be alone in
I always needed you to look out for me
Oh baby, I'm gonna miss your lovin' arms
They're the only arms I feel at home in
Don't you know how lonely I'm gonna be

"Dancers to a Discordant system
Listen to the hidden tune
The essence of lies in note defined
As we dance to the dissonant sway
The choreography refined
Will subdued and shackled
Reason washed aside
Pledging our love to the chains
Our ignorance ever amplified

Blooded hands lead the waltz
We're trapped in the out of tune swirl
Still we set the show on continue mode
And dance to a discordant system

We accept the nails we're fed
Lies sharpened to bleed us silent
Muted from the pains
Defiance employed in vain
Any attempts to leave the dance
Invisibly suppressed
Questions unasked, we learn the steps
Eyes shut like all the rest

Unsuspecting, willing, blind, controllable herd
Pawns in a covert game conducted by hands we trust
Dominated, compliant and deceptable
Confident that we matter, we don't see that we're but dust

Committed to a lie we cannot see, cannot know nor comprehend
We're all asinine drones kept in the dark, kept in line

Confined, bereft of reason
Withering in toxicity
The deadly fumes deceit
And we all reek of complicity
Humbled, brought to our knees
By the weight of our own guilt
Our innocent ways the catalyst
To injustice and inhumanity

We dance, to appease
Compete in stupidity

Obscured faces file our points
Numbers fed to the machine
Still we stand in line for the next show
The human spine liquefied
What are we, but stupefied
Dancers to a discordant system

We believe, so we're misled
We assume, so we're played
We confide, so we're deceived
We trust, so we're betrayed",Metal,Metal

I wanna hide a while
Behind your smile,

To help me to leave all my blues behind.

When you talk they move, painting what you say
So I understand more than words can tell

In the light it moves, red and green are brown
All the time it takes for a night to pass
And a lifetime grows as the day comes down

Finally we are alone tonight
I'm gonna turn down the lights

"Have you seen Bruce Richard Reynolds? He's a man we'd like to find. They say the great train robbery, He was the mastermind. And his firm they pulled the greatest turn, The world has ever known. 2 million quid was stolen, The firm split for parts unknown. (Chorus) Have you seen Bruce Richard Reynolds? He's a man we must detain. He's wanted for the robbery of the Glasgow/Euston train. Age 32, height six foot one, eyes gray, his hair is brown, Apprehend Bruce Richard Reynolds he is wanted by the crown. Well Reynolds and some people got together as a firm, While doin' bird in Wormwood Scrubs he heard about a turn. To rob a train, but it needed brains, so Reynolds scratched his head, ""When I done my bird then rob that train,"" that's what he said. When Reynolds left his prison cell he started on his scheme, He contacted ol' Gordon G. and Charlie Wilson's team. They came to an arrangement and a partnership was made, By summer '63 the scene was set for Reynold's game. Yeah! On the night of August 8th you know the rig went like a dream, One-hundred and twenty mail-bags full of money was stolen by the team. But someone left his finger prints and the guys were soon on charge, But they only caught the muscle cause the brains were still at large. Yeah! On the grape-vine came to news, that Mister Reynolds made a vow, ""Well no-one grassed on me,"" he said, ""I can't desert them now."" ""The iron bars and prison walls, they do not bother me,"" ""I robbed the mail, so I'll rob the jails and set my whole firm free."" By August '64 ol' Charlie Wilson left his cell, By late in '65 Ron Biggs said 'adios' as well. Have you seen Bruce Richard Reynolds? He's a mastermind you know: Just walking through the walls of jails and letting his firm go!",Electronic,Folk
"I lit my love and watched it burn: Asking nothing in return. Except the lessons I will learn. From holding crazy faith. I've been touched by that bright fire. Down to the root of my desire, While the smoke, it rises higher. Glowing crazy faith. You're not asking if I love this man. I know you don't, you don't believe you can. Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan. It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so: It tells me. Am I a fool for hanging long? Would I be a fool for being long gone. When is daylight gonna dawn, On my crazy faith. The questions will not let me sleep, The dance is buried way too deep. But the bottom lover, lover's keep, Made by crazy faith. You're not asking if I love this man. I know you don't, you don't believe you can. Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan. It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so: It tells me. Love you're losin', those you love, Let the hope fly from the glove. Do not search the skies above. Search your crazy faith. Love is lightning, love is ice. It only strikes the lucky twice. Once or you will know the price. And once for crazy faith. You're not asking if I love this man. I know you don't, you don't believe you can. Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan. It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so.",Country,R&B

"You read the papers today?-
I read the news today oh boy,
About a tragic comedy
Newspaper hinted suicide,

The letterhead read dear johnny
A tainted truth was all it said,
Sleep tight now that
You've made your bed

An arrow that once pierced your heart
Points to the apple on your head

Three sides to every story
Yours, mine
And, Monday morning's

Cupid's dead, headlines read,
Cupid's dead
Cupid's dead, headlines read,
Cupid's dead

Oh, romeo, oh, romeo
Where did our love go, romeo?
If you read between the headlines,
You wouldn't be the last to know

No mystery yet to unfold,
A paperboy left in the cold
A love was said to never die,
Withered away and just got old

""our top story tonight,
Is a crime of passion
The victim, an unidentified man,
Is found in bed, wearing only a diaper,

Holding a bow an arrow in one hand,
And clutching a letter in the other.
The letter simply read ...
Cupid's dead.""

Extra, extra, extra,
Read all about it

Cupid's dead,
Cupid is dead, deceased,
I got peace of mind
Still it's hard to forget,

What it leaves behind
A lot of love lost,
Your feelings are wasted,
Tasted the sweetness,

But now you're faced with,
The thought, of being alone
Nor more companionship,
You can handle it,

Just abandon it,
Leave it behind,
And look for the brighter day
Give it some time,

'Cause it won't come right away
You gotta be standing strong,
Hold on to your dignity
Don't sit around,

Saying look what ya did to me
It's time to move on,
You gotta continue
To look for a love,

Of a life that's within you
Cupid is dead now,
It's time to rely on,
Yourself to cope

You got no shoulder to cry on

All the time spent behind the wheel, I remember the faces of people
Who did me wrong there, and they were, oh, so many to know

I don't even remember a name, patiently they wait and see
Where will he run to now? And they were, oh, so many to know

I was born a dream chaser, running away from the country
That made me rock 'n' roll, you're a home breaker turnin' my head
From the family that loved me, and I hate it, how I hate leaving you

But what more can I do than to try and find my way?
Carry me on to somewhere, send me someone who will share it all
Help me to find my peace of mind

Harder than those before and I'll remember the faces of friends
If I ever go back again, they were also many to know

Young girls flag the johns who troll the block in circles,
Waiting for their moment to take the plunge.

All of us crossing paths.

We're all in the same place but it seems
We're living in parallel worlds.

I try to imagine the predator's stinking breath,
His body against mine, the foulness when he's spent.

All of us passing by.

Somewhere in the alleys of our minds
We all have our secret worlds.

Some are haunted by memories,
Some have an impulse to be cruel,
And they're watching intently
To see who they can use.

You don't know who's a freak,
And on this street they're out here lurking all the time.

Amidst the swirling snow I saw a friend out jonesing and cold,
She was pacing and waiting alone for an unknown.

I guess that life has taken its toll.
The vultures circle close.
At any moment we might slip and fall.
The jackals are waiting, waiting for us all.",Folk,Indie

and i don't want nobody else to have you,",R&B,R&B
I had to look through our old pictures To see the way we used to smile Before we left love in the closet Like it just went out of style Can we pull out those old feelin's Wipe the hurt away like dust Make love shine the way it used to shine Find the gold beneath the rust That's all I need to know Do you want to stay together Just say let's don't let go And I'll keep holdin' on forever Have the teardrops that you've cried Drowned the fire in your eyes Is there one flame beneath the smoke Tell me is there any hope That's all I need to know Is it too late to recover Those old smiles we used to wear Can we save a love that once was strong Before it breaks beyond repair,Country,Country
"Now at last I know
What a fool I've been
For I've lost the last love
I shall ever win

And at last I see
How my heart was blind
To the joys before me
That I left behind

When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And a lark was heard in the still
Where was I
Where was I

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely
Now at last I know

When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And a lark was heard in the still
Where was I
Where was I

When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely
Now at last I know",Jazz,Country
"Last Halloween when the devil grinned
The tattoos on your face covered up your skin
Scarred from the sin and those sleepless nights
Trying to find a fight you can't win

So you chased him, traded that good life
Only got yourself another good night
Until the morning darling
When you're right back to

Falling apart, falling apart, you know you're falling apart
Just another little lonely broken heart
How did you get so cold
(You'll never know, you 'll never know)
How did you get so cold

Life is short and you're no longer young enough
To throw around your body for a little fun
Put another photo, spend my cash
Put another photo, have a blast

Now it's gone and I'm dark and your heart is still crawling
It heals, since you kneel
And at baggage claim bawling til the morning darling
And you're right back to

Falling apart, falling apart, you know you're falling apart
Just another little lonely broken heart
How did you get so cold
(You'll never know, you'll never know)
How did you get so cold

You slip away into the morning sun
When he touches your face and your day's begun
I know you hate yourself for what, what you've done
So you push it away, it's getting harder to run

When you run so fast and you run so long
And it's all your fault cause you were never strong
It's not much of a life though darling
It's not much of a life (life)

When you're falling apart,
Falling apart, you know you're falling apart
Just another little lonely broken heart
How did you get so cold

When you're falling apart,
Falling apart, you know you're falling apart
Just another little lonely broken heart
How did you get so cold
(You'll never know, you'll never know)

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh oh
You never been nothing, baby
You never been nothing, baby
Falling apart, you know you're falling apart
Just another little lonely broken heart
How did you get so cold
How did you get so cold

Falling apart, you know you're falling apart
Just another little lonely broken heart
How did you get so cold
How did you get so cold",Indie,R&B

If you go near the lake
Keep your eyes wide open

Now, maybe you won't see him
And maybe you won't hear

And drink all your root beer

Wiggling and a-hissing
Sneaky snake goes dancing
A-giggling and a-kissing
I don't like old sneaky snake
He laughs too much you see
When he goes wiggling through the grass
It tickles his underneath

And he just makes me sick
When he is not dancing 
He looks just like stick

Now he doesn't have any arms or legs
You cannot see his ears
And while we are not looking
He's stealing all of our beer

Breathe, now blow

Running in the gutter)

Wolves howl and any hour cross 'em, and they'll devour you in a second
Better mind how you walk through
Making it out alive is something to hope to
On my life there's wonder and terror and beauty and danger
Independent here on my own still doing it major
Here you cannot be on the phone so do me a favour
W-w-wait, slow down
Rabbit holes where it goes down
Do not interrupt the flow now
Look at me
Eyes peeled, know that you're gonna be healed
I've been down in nitty-gritty and stayed in the Hills
I've been all over the world now but never to chill
Been exposed to finer things and Italian meals
What a change

Been partying for days on the same shit (Same shit)
Never mind who I came with
Man I never ever want to leave, let me stay lit

I know you learning ways of this place and you show your concerns
And I understand how you feel, but fuck how you feel
You can only eat if you hunt and are you willing to kill
Mercy is never shown and damn it, it's all I've known
Remember to pay your debts, this shit is some Game of Thrones
All I wanna know is right now is you with me?
Come fuck with me here there's no love for you in the city
I can show you magic I swear this shit is so trippy
Only you can have it let's make a deal quick
On some real shit

Does she dress the part?

Suck the poison out of me

Make you come

I'm gonna hang with all my friends you hate

Better without you

This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down
I suppose this is how the story goes, but
Ever since that door closed, I've been going down, down, down, down
The drain and the pain got me nauseous
I should have been more cautious or clever
Whatever, you'll never find a dude with a better headgame, and
You can take that both ways
You laughin like I'm playin wit your fingers up like oh ___
Wish you would have a threesome without me I pull a O
G.
And text you something criminal and pictures from my old days
I felt the bite
Take a spit
Suck the poison out of me
I'll make you beg
Make you come
To your senses
If you keep up the shit, take the hit, dig the grave
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down
Gonna run
Gonna scream
Gonna crawl round on your knees
When you realize that no one's gonna measure up to me
Doesn't matter cause I'm over it now
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down
Somebody doesn't like you
Cause you're not such a bigshot dude
Might wanna rethink it through
Coulda asked me, I woulda told you the truth
Somebody doesn't like you

Shoulda asked me, I woulda told you the truth",Rock,Pop
"This is the moment
We'll remember
Every day for the rest of our lives
Time may rush us
Hurt or love us
But on this day we have arrived
It's been a long time coming
We've been in the running for so long
But now we're on our way

Side by side and make us
See the world through new eyes every day

I've paid my dues
I fought my way up from the ground

The crowd acclaim us
Will you just listen to that sound!

The love and laughter
Now the world is at our feet
Looking back on all the times
We felt downcast
Didn't think we were going anywhere
Just living in the past

You get inspiration

After what I've gone through,
All on account of you,
Tearing my heart in two?

Woman, have you no conscience,
How could you be so bold?
Why have you grown so cold
After the lies you told?

No-one now seems to be on the level,
Since I've found out that my angel was just a dog,
Known as the devil!

Why does I love ya, hon,
Why did you teach me how?
After you broke each vow,
How can you face me now?

Oh you dirty dog, get out in the street!
Get out!  Get out!
How can you face me now?

No, I didn't go there last night!
No, I didn't go there, neither,

"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again",Jazz,Country

I don't want to hear another word about young lovers

She's been to see the doctor, so you hope that she recovers.

You say you don't come

Don't wanna be a goody-goody.
I don't want just anybody.
No, I don't want anybody
saying 'You belong to me
You belong to me.'

"Our sun is set, our day is done, I'm left here wondering
Is this the end, my final words to you
Day turned to night and now you're gone, I'm left here pondering
Can this be true, are we really through

You were the wind beneath my wings, taught me how to fly
With you I lived among the kings, how could this ever die

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever,
And I always will be

We were one, we were all, we were the only
Future full of hope, nothing could stand in our way
But dreams can change, visions fall, I feel so lonely
I would walk through fire for just one more day

You were the angel of my life, taught me to be free
Now I'm a stranger in your eyes, walls are closing in on me

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I always will be
Missing you, in my heart you are the one
And you always will be

When I turn to the east, I see no dawn,
But after darkness comes the light
And when I turn to the west, the silent night hides all
Where is the light that shines so bright

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I always will be
Missing you, in my heart you are the one
And you always will be

Nah-nah-na, and you always will be
Nah-nah-na, and you always will be
And you always will be

And you always will be",Metal,Folk

I woke to see my baby missing from bed (yes I did, yes I did)
And lying there on her pillow
It was a letter and it read (ooh girl yeah yeah)

We just don't do things we used to do, no no

And I questioned myself like where when how
She could leave me this way
She didn't fuss or complain
And I'm thinking she's fine
But she knew all the time
She would leave us behind
Broke that promise she lied
Now my kids teary eyed

A red hawk rides the sky
I guess I should be happy
Just to be alive...

And oblivious to it all
The cell phone zombies babble
Through the shopping malls
While condors fall from Indian skies
Whales beach and die in sand...
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan.
You cannot be trusted
Do you even know you're lying
It's dangerous to kid yourself
You go deaf and dumb and blind.
You take with such entitlement.
You give bad attitude.
You have no grace
No empathy
No gratitude
You have no sense of consequence
Oh my head is in my hands...
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan.
Before that altering apple
We were one with everything
No sense of self and other
No self-consciousness.
But now we have to grapple
With our man-made world backfiring
Keeping one eye on our brother's deadly selfishness.
And everyone's a victim!
Nobody's hands are clean.
There's so very little left of wild Eden Earth
So near the jaws of our machines.
We live in these electric scabs.
These lesions once were lakes.
No one knows how to shoulder the blame
Or learn from past mistakes...
So who will come to save the day?
Mighty Mouse?
Superman?

"Take a look around when you're going down
'Cause you'll never feel so high
As when you hid in her arms in the sky and the world slept

And there's no use to say just how much it kills
When it still kills all the same
Every thought of her name like a hand to an open flame

She was the heart in your heartbreak
She was the miss in your mistake
And no matter what you take,
You're never going to forget
She was the tear in a rainstorm
She was the promise that you would've sworn
And no matter what you say,
It's never gonna come back

An ambulance goes by, and you wonder why
It never stops when you want it to
It never stops when you need it to take you away

And your friends don't understand that the world could end,
And it would feel no worse than this
Every thought of the look in her eye
Like a cold California sky

She was the heart in your heartbreak
She was the miss in your mistake
And no matter what you take,
You're never going to forget
She was the tear in a rainstorm
She was the promise that you would've sworn
And no matter what you say,
It's never gonna come back

And no matter what you pray,
It's never gonna take the pain away
And even if she'd stay you know it's wrong

Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this,

With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Gather 'round kids, gather all 'round the campfire

'Cause they won't mean a thing
When everything's been said.
No need for fancy cards or flowery prose
Though I suppose
They make us feel less bad.
No need for long, drawn-out explaining 
How and when, and why, this love came to an end
No need to to tell me so sincerely
You still want to be my friend.

A little bitter, but it's sweet
You always wanted one
It comes a little late, but it's complete
It's from the heart
Please remember: I love you dearly
Although we have to part.

No need to gather up the evidence 
To justify the emptiness inside
No need to pray and turn for guidance to the Providence:
It simply won't provide.
No need to ask your friends 
For well-intentioned Good Advice 
They're happy to oblige.
(And though I know you want to)
No need to promise we will work it out
And start again
Let's simply turn the page.

And you always wanted one
It comes a little late, but it's complete

Because it's driving you away

And inspiring things to say.
No need to worry so about me

I'm landing on my feet

"There are ghosts out in the rain tonight
High up in those ancient trees
Lord, I've given up without a fight
Another blind fool on his knees
And all the Gods that I've abandoned

Begin to speak in simple tongues
Lord, suddenly I've come to know
There are no roads left to run
Now it's the hour of dogs a-barking

That's what the old ones used to say
It's first light or it's sundown
Before the children cease their play
When the mountains glow like mission wine

And turn gray like a Spanish roan
Ten thousand eyes will stop to worship
And turn away and head on home
She is reaching out her arms tonight

Lord, my poverty is real
I pray roses shall rain down on me
From Guadalupe on her hill
But who am I to doubt these mysteries
Cured in centuries of blood and candle smoke
I am the least of all your pilgrims here

I am most in need of hope
She appeared to Juan Diego
She left her image on his cape
Five hundred years of sorrow

Have not destroyed their deepest faith
But here I am your ragged disbeliever
Old doubting Thomas drowns in tears
As I watched your church sink through the earth

Like a heart worn down through fear
She is reaching out her arms tonight
Lord, my poverty is real
I pray roses shall rain down on me
From Guadalupe on her hill

But who am I to doubt these mysteries
Cured in centuries of blood and candle smoke

Where a few flowers grew

"Our day has come
It's drawn in the sky
So don't shead a tear now
Be thankful for the time

Life wouldn't be so precious dear if there never was an end

Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away

We stand on the edge now
We've come so far
Through all the dust it becomes clear
You will always be my heart

There's no death, no end of time when I'm facing it with you

Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us Acid rain

Stand near to me
Don't look be brave
Over the blackened moon
I'll carry you away
Through the planets we fly

Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us Acid rain

Send us home
Send us home
Send us home
Send us home",Metal,Indie
"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

I love you more

And it ain't funny

"I was driving across the burning desert
When I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak
terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens
it was the strings of my guitar
Amelia, it was just a false alarm
The drone of flying engines
Is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue
Of picture-post-card-charms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm
People will tell you where they've gone
They'll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise
Others just come to harm
Oh Amelia, it was just a false alarm
I wish that he was here tonight
It's so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt
As the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia, it was just a false alarm
A ghost of aviation
She was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea, like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending
On beautiful foolish arms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm
Maybe I've never really loved
I guess that is the truth
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
And looking down on everything
I crashed into his arms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm
I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel
To shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s
Over geometric farms
Dreams, Amelia, dreams and false alarms",Folk,Folk

"Undying nightfall, a king with no crown
Dethroned, imprisoned in chains
Duel the black horse, the Swordsmen must kneel
Condemned to serve within the shadows
Put 'em next to their King

Out of the fire and into the night
A handful of brave men appeared
Crimson thunder running through their veins
A bond that will last forever
Nothing's stronger than

Brothers in arms are fighting tonight
The Forces of steel meet again
Born in the fire, they look to the sky
Power of metal unchained

Time has come, break out of these chains
Fight! proud for your kingdom
Behind the defenders the king marches on
By divine intervention
They are fighting with 

Brothers in arms are fighting tonight
The Forces of Steel live again
Born in the fire, they look to the sky
The power of metal unchained

Past many nights they fought on
And by the moonlight the battle was won
But still the black horse is running
Knowing were the power will lead

"Quiet please, there's a lady on stage
She may not be the latest rage
But she's singing and she means it
And she deserves a little silence

Quiet please, there's a woman up there
And she's been honest through her songs
Long before your consciousness was raised
Now doesn't that deserve a little praise

So put your hands together and help her along
All that's left of the singer's all that's left of the song
Stand for the ovation
And give her one last celebration

Quiet please, there's a person up there
Who's singing of the things
That none of us could bear to hear for ourselves
Give her your respect if nothing else

Put your hands together and help her along
All that's left of the singer's all that's left of the song
Rise to the occasion
Give her one last celebration

Quiet please, there's a lady on stage
Conductor, turn the final page
When it's over we can all go home
She lives on, on the stage alone

So put your hands together, help her along
All that's left of the singer's all that's left of the song
Stand for the ovation
And give her one last celebration

Put your hands together and help her along
All that's left of the singer's all that's left of the song

Curtains faded, thread bill rugs real nice -the baby stayed up all night

How wonderful rhinestones on black satin shoes
How beautiful the one's I never get to use
No frills, no fuss, perfectly us - unglamorous

Frozen dinner, jelly glass of wine - tastes just fine
Two bread winners, five kids in short time -with eyes just like mine

How wonderful crowded dinners at the kitchen table
How beautiful one TV set - no cable
No frills, no fuss, perfectly us - unglamorous

No diamonds in our bathtub reams
Peanut butter on everything

How beautiful old wool socks on a bedroom floor

Oh but mercy, we used to love all day and drive all night
Oh mercy, jealousy used to whet your appetite
Oh mercy, we were low as dogs and high as kites
Why must I plead with you darling
Why must I plead with you darling
Why must I plead with you darling
For what's already mine

Well my friends are indiscreet
And I sing myself to sleep
I don't mind the red wine
Or the pick-up line as long as it's cheap
Oh I ask you what's what and you say I'm all yours
I ask who your friend is and you say it's Santa Claus
I ask you to come home, 
You say you're tired of being indoors

Oh but mercy, you know you signed on that dotted line
Oh mercy, you signed yours and I signed mine
Oh mercy, you said forever till the end of time
Oh why must I plead with you darling
Why must I plead with you darling
Oh why must I plead with you darling
For what's already mine
I said why must I plead with you darling
For what's already mine",Folk,Country

"Deep underwater
Is where I left my love
Clean at the surface
Shallow to the touch
Nothing left
He's a wreck
Buried deep in the sand
Now I don't feel a thing
When I'm holding his hand
And I'm asking myself
Will I shiver again?
Oh, I know how to feel
I know that love exists
It's asleep with the fishes
Down in Atlantis
Oh, my Lord, where's my soul?
How did we end up like this?
Fast asleep with the fishes
Down in Atlantis
Dig a little deeper
Baby, hold your breath
Take a seat at the counter
Just give it a chance
Every bro in the building
With his back to the wall
Not for me, be discreet
I should try not to yawn
I shut em down
Shut em down
Like a sniper on call
Oh, I know how to feel
I know that love exists
But it's asleep with the fishes
Down in Atlantis
Oh, my Lord, where's my soul?
How did we end up like this?
Fast asleep with the fishes
Down in Atlantis
Hey, hey
I know sometimes we lose sight of hope
I know that you don't falter often, when you do, you grow
I know that life can have you lost like your compass broke
A ship adrift at sea, oh me just tryna be your rope..
oh
And I don't think they really know the rest of it
Everyday is Friday, so your calendar irrelevant
Photobombing planets, never planned to take a better pic
Knocking on Atlantis doors, I'm surprised they let us in, let us in
I can see you working on your patience
Working on your nerves, need a better occupation
You just say the word, and then we right back to the basics
When you out here ballin' guess you bound to catch a flagrant
I'm just tryna wild out with the fam
We came from the bottom, I don't think you understand
House up in the sky, I guess that always was the plan
You was flying with me, I think I forgot to land
Oh, I know how to feel
I know that love exists
But it's asleep with the fishes
Down in Atlantis
Oh, my Lord, where's my soul?

"The truth can hurt you
Or the truth can change you
What would truth do to you

I just wanna be happy
But if I keep on doing the things
That keep on bringing me pain
There's no one else I can blame
If I'm not happy
Wasted time but now I can see
The biggest enemy it was me
So I'm not happy

Cry yourself to sleep
Shout and raise your hands
It wont change a thing child
Until you understand

If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say Jesus take the wheel
He knows the road that you need to take
(But it only works if)
If you wanna be happy
(Look at yourself and say)
Don't you wanna be happy
I just wanna be happy

But if I keep on giving my heart
For people to tear apart
The healing will never start
So I can be happy
Will I ever be happy

Cry yourself to sleep
Shout and raise your hands
It wont change a thing child
Until you understand

(If I'm talking to you then say)
If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way
(You been down too long)
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say Jesus take the wheel
He knows the road that you need to take
(I feel different right here)
It's so easy to complain
Addicted to the pain
You give you heart, they push it away
(But I got good news for ya)
Jesus knows just how you feel
Just let him take the wheel
The love you need, he already gave
(But the question is)
Do you wanna be happy
(If you're tired of you then say)
I just wanna be happy
(Now if you really mean that, open up your heart and say it)

Let me hear you say yeah
Yeah yeah
(If you're tired of going in circles)
Let me hear you say yeah
Yeah yeah
(Tired of making the same mistakes)
Let me hear you say yeah
Yeah yeah

Let me hear you say yeah
(Say yeah)

If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way

Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say Jesus take the wheel

He knows the road that you need to take

You give you heart, they push it away

"I'm like a Bat Out of Hell, being pulled by Black Stallions. Waiting for Metallica to make another Black Album. Created a stone age cage, I'm fenced in. Watching doves cry in this purple rain that I'm drenched in. I'm having a clean day, when I clash with the sounds. Now I'm a basketcase, until you come around. This world's like a vortex trying to suck me in, I'm lucky to play the role of a drowning Jeff Buckley. I'm an OutKast in the state of Atliens, Now throw your hands in the air and do the hokey dance. Jane's Addiction got me seeing deep purple. Need to find the perfect tool to make A Perfect Circle. Riding a white pony? That explains my Deftones. I'm Illmatic like a storm on this microphone. Walking across Abbey Road with Ringo Starr. But Yoko Ono was dead, so we had to split apart! There's a million zombies in my backyard, backyard. And they all wanna be rapstars, rapstars. They need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up. You need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up. There's a million zombies in my backyard, backyard. And they all wanna be rockstars, rockstars. They need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up. But you need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up. I'm a Stone Temple Pilot, riding this Crazy Train. I need a Black Sabbath to break Alice from her chains. Rode into Iowa with a Slip and a Knot, ''cause i got a Liscence to Ill, so whatcha, whatcha want? On a Black Sunday, I walked up Cypress Hill, until I crashed into a dashboard and walked into a confessional. I'm just an Audioslave on the run, in a SoundGarden waiting for this Blackhole Sun to come. My crew is my feelings, sprayed Led like Zeppelin. Trying to find my way up the Stairway To Heaven. I'll trick you with this massive attack of Back In Black. Raging Against the Machine just like Zack. I used to have the common sense to walk or die. Used to hold Guns And Roses, now I hold double revolvers. Met this girl named Charlotte, she looked Good in my bed, 'til my Bizket went Limp ''cause she wouldn't give me Portishead. There's a million zombies in my backyard, backyard. And they all wanna be rapstars, rapstars. They need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up. You need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up. There's a million zombies in my backyard, backyard. And they all wanna be rockstars, rockstars. They need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up. But you need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up. I found a Message in a Bottle so I called the Police. I met a Material Girl who said Poppa Don't Preach. They say love bites like an angry Def Lepperd, like a Nine Inch Nail being pushed in by Trent Rezner. I got a Sex Pistol and a Gang of Bloodhounds, who walked up to a House of Pain and made Lethal Jump Around. I ate Chop Suey while watching System of a Down, fell asleep in Linkin's Park and woke up in Marcy's Playground. Sniffing White Stripes with a Seven Nation Army, waiting for Marilyn Manson to egg it on me. Public Police got me lost in mix tapes. Oops, I did it again, and I made Britney Spears my slave. I made it to Brooklyn and I still can't sleep. I got a Radiohead, now they call me a creep. I parachute on a cold day, when I Coldplay the streets. I'm dieing to be famous, like both of J-lo's ass cheeks. There's a million zombies in my backyard, backyard. And they all wanna be rapstars, rapstars. They need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up. You need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up. There's a million zombies in my backyard, backyard. And they all wanna be rockstars, rockstars. They need to wake, wake up, wake up, wake up.

From a post up high,
From where you see the ships afar,
From a well trained eye,
The waves all keep on crashing by,

You better give a piece of ass,
Give a piece of your ass,

Post hypnotic suggestions,
Running the ships ashore,
The orange light that follows,
Will soon proclaim itself a god,
If you point your questions,
The fog will surely chew you up,
But if you want the answers,
You better get ready for the fire,
Get ready for the fire,

And they're coming close to the shore sir, shore sir,

What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's getting less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll f**k you right I will, I'll f**k you right I will
I'll f**k you like no one has ever ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes
Ooh, I'm willin' to work it out however longer how it takes
You feel like you missed out on those happy days
Well, girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my Mrs.
And the hardest part about the f**kin' business is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we're tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fighting, let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send ‘er back around
(T.I.)
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ay, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I ju' keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches, then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like the chim-i-ney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside, it's killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, no, that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah-ha, didn't you think you would be over me
By now, so you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her peace, I know, capisce, so love must be let go, released
Into the wind, begin again, them deuces I must throw ya, peace

You should have a travel agent, 'cause you a trip

Give her a kiss from me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gon' be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever

But when I cut ‘em off, they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows, and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch, and turned it to his new bitch
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on

But I'm a player, ain't gon' tell ya all the details
What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
By the seashore, but she's not a bore
But neither a whore, who needs to know more?
The kind you can't ignore but want to open the door
For, or, run in your favorite store
And leave with all them shoppin' bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her, ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this was all that she came for
But enough to know tonight, excited, she came four
Times, to my cousin house to see if I was there
Getcha minds, out the gutter, man, we out here tryna have a good
Time, and here I am all heavy with the word swear

His way was hogs and his nature was tough

Here I am in this dang bed and who's gonna feed them hogs?"" 

Four hundred hogs comes to eight hundred hams
And that's a lot of money for a hog-raisin' man
Four hundred hogs comes to sixteen hundred feet
The market's up and there are people a-waitin' on that meat 

Well, the doctors say they do not know what saved the man from death
But in a few days he put on his overalls and he left
That's all there is to this small song but waitress, before you leave,
Would you bring me some coffee and a hot ham sandwich, please? 

Four hundred hogs they're just standing out there
His wife couldn't feed 'em and his neighbors didn't care
They couldn't get out and roam around like his old huntin' dogs...",Folk,Country

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.

And all that I have I'll give my all to you;

"There's a fruit store on our street
It's run by a Greek.
And he keeps good things to eat
But you should hear him speak!
When you ask him anything, he never answers ""no"".
He just ""yes""es you to death, and as he takes your dough
He tells you
""Yes, we have no bananas
We have-a no bananas today.
We've string beans, and onions
Cabbageses, and scallions,
And all sorts of fruit and say
We have an old fashioned to-mah-to
A Long Island po-tah-to
But yes, we have no bananas.
We have no bananas today.""

Business got so good for him that he wrote home today,
""Send me Pete and Nick and Jim; I need help right away.""
When he got them in the store, there was fun, you bet.
Someone asked for ""sparrow grass"" and then the whole quartet
All answered
""Yes, we have no bananas
We have-a no bananas today.
Just try those coconuts
Those walnuts and doughnuts
There ain't many nuts like they.
We'll sell you two kinds of red herring,
Dark brown, and ball-bearing.
But yes, we have no bananas
We have no bananas today.""

Yes, we are very sorry to inform you
That we are entirely out of the fruit in question
The afore-mentioned vegetable
Bearing the cognomen ""Banana"".
We might induce you to accept a substitute less desirable,
But that is not the policy at this internationally famous green 
grocery.
I should say not. No no no no no no no.
But may we suggest that you sample our five o'clock tea
Which we feel certain will tempt your pallet?
However we regret that after a diligent search 
Of the premises
By our entire staff
We can positively affirm without fear of contradiction
That our raspberries are delicious; really delicious
Very delicious
But we have no bananas today.

"It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
Saw a shooting star and thought of you
Sang a lullaby by the water side and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away froom seeing you
I can see the stars from America
I wonder, do you see them too?
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these skies will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of the stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lands and streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So, can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam
You're the song my heart is beating to?
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of the stars will guide us home

"I've been thinking I should write some kinda lovesong for you
To prove to you I do

It shouldn't be too hard to write
I'll just think of that time I first met you in Omaha
You were stranded on Jackson with a bus fare to who knows where
I took you in right then and there
And life took on a new form

No more staying out all night
No more killing ourselves just to make ourselves feel alright
No more sleeping with strangers and those awkward goodbyes

I've never had much family never had too many friends
Then you came wandering through
And pompously I took you for granted
That's why I gotta write this little, this little love song for you

I'll sing about those Denver mornings you'd wake up bawling about a long lost kid
Your maternal instincts were kicking in
As the sun dazzled bright above the peaks
You brought home a dog you found in the alley
You said ""Can't we keep her?"" 
I said ""What kinda man would I be?""
So you bought her a collar and called her family

Writers are selfish
Writers are egotists
I'm afraid I'm as bad as it gets

I keep forgetting to censor the truth
That why I better write some kinda, some kinda love song for you
I'm driving cross country in a U-Haul
On the hunt for our new home
High atop Eagle Rock
We found a house with a big backyard
So we picked up yet another mutt
From the Crenshaw pound
Sipping coffee on the porch while the dogs wrestle on the lawn
I'm sorry I've had my doubts
We're a family of strays but together we've been found

To be one with the crowd
Unveil the sacred order, hymns of falling down
You told the greatest stories
Of love and bleeding crowns
But to the sick and hungry
You cannot be found

Through strength in self we become
Something more than they can be
I raise my heart and sing
That I won't believe this lie
I know there's something more inside
When darkness is all you see
This is our sweet blasphemy
Silence the crooked holy, unchain the tied and bound
No time for allegory, one true reigning sound
Unite the lonely mourning, a simple servant now
We are the only glory, hear us screaming loud
We are young and we are strong
I raise my heart and sing! (Oh!)

And we'll drink in the dawn

Sees beyond sexuality
Holds the sun in the palm of its hand
And laughs down the cynical man

Hear what I say, hear what I see
Two kisses sweet on Bermondsey Street

Regardless of religion
Braver than any faith
No fear of society
Evolves you and me

"When I first came to town
They called me the roving jewel
Now they've changed their tune
They call me Katy Cruel
Oh diddle day, oh diddle lie o day

Oh that I was where I would be
Then I would be where I am not
Here I am where I must be
Go where I would, I can not
Oh diddle day, oh diddle lie o day

When I first came to town
They brought me the bottles plenty
Now they've changed their tune
They bring me the bottles empty

And I know who does love me
I know where I'm going
And I know whose going with me

And through the boggy mire
Straight way cross the field
And to my heart's desire

"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",Jazz,Jazz
"Mountain of mystery,
Rising high above the clouds.
Mountain of magic,
Standing tall and proud,
Your magical veins
Flowing silver and gold,
Your cumulus cloud glows misty red,
As Apollo sets beyond your head.
Releasing the pressure built over the years
The mountain is crying hot lava tears
Molten rock created under vibrations of
Sub-terranean thunder
Ejecting boulders like pieces of sand
The mountain is
Giving birth to the land.

Under your feet you feel a rumble
As thousands of rocks are starting to tumble
Above the trees where the buzzard flies
Swirling vapors begin to rise
Beneath those misty peaks you hide
A tremendous force boiling deep inside..",Rock,Electronic

they said our feelings would change
just give it time

"Contagious a breed of disease 
Airborne created to kill 
Boiling intestines flesh eating plague 
The skin is covered in wounds 
Parasite an infectious spice 
Screaming from deep within

Sanity a conquered illusion 

Carrier of world destroyer

A breed to inflict mankind 
Nervous system close to collapse 
Respiratory arrest creating panic 
The skin falls apart flesh decompose 
A mind possessed by itself 
Blood from the ears, blood from the eyes 
Melting in a pile of gore

From the hollowed body 
The bowels fall to the ground 
A smell of recent slaughter 

a lot of coagulated blood 
Process of slaughter limb by limb 
Muscles stretch until they burst 
Mind explodes in madness 

Eyeballs turn inside out 
Brain activity turns to zero 
No blood left inside the body 
Everything burst into pieces 

Morbid ending for a morbid infection 
Fed by the taste of mankind 
Dismembered in a thousand ways 
To be a host to the plague

Abranded human covered by death 
Human experiments out of control

While trying to make sense of your situation
What we got ourselves in, two more weeks of one way conversation
She says she's losing interest
I swear that we are best friends till the end

This could be the plans for revenge
But these words lead to dead ends

So close your eyes and kiss me like it's our last time
These lips need medication, these days are dripping poison girl
Days to turn to nights I wish on the stars in the sky
Be careful of the brightest, beauty is on the inside

I wish I could but I know I can't take it back, it's serious
Just like heart-attacks
My personality, avoid the scenery, I hate playing games with the industry
That fuels these dreams, and turns them down
When my heart breaks it makes a sound

This could be the plans for revenge
But these words lead to dead ends

So close your eyes and kiss me like it's our last time
These lips need medication, these days are dripping poison girl
Days to turn to nights I wish on the stars in the sky
Be careful of the brightest, beauty is on the inside

"Come pretty young girls give me your attention
To these few lines I've tried to write
About a man who I won't mention
Who courted of his charming bride

And when her parents came to know him
They tried so hard both day and night
To separate here and her own true lover
Her and her own true hearts delight

She turned her back upon the city
She viewed the fields and meadows round
She came upon a broad river
And in the shade of a tree sat down

Her true love being not far behind 
He heard her make a mournful sound
And looking on her lifeless body 
As she lay cold upon the ground

He then took out his silver weapon
He pierced it through his tender heart
Sayin let this be a dreadful warning
For all true lovers that have to part

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

And you can get it if you try

Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

"Bad dreams are makin' me cry
Brush that sand from your eye
Get you up and out on the dry
So many things we never tried to do
We can make them true

So get out your sleepy head
It's time to make the bed
At least get partially dressed
Lift a finger to quell my unrest

I've waited too long tryin' to get through to you
We can make it all true

Lift your head off of the bed
Don't worry about which side
They both lead away from the night

You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
Wake up your sleepy head

See a bloody finger scratch
Lift out her that's a trap
Wake up and come and stretch

Lead a march through fields of hay
They're all following you anyway

Wanna make a day into something new
We can make it all true

You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head

In a world of lies
But when I see love right there in my baby's eyes

I can hold on to that something we've got
I can be strong, just strong enough for the two of us
Into the shadows of love we go
A familiar heartland at the edge of home
On a long road I'll see you there

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Take it all back and forget.

My best mistakes where the ones I'd never trade,
Never fade or replace.

Welcome to my life lived out loud
Throw all the secrets out, take the words from my mouth
Welcome to my life lived out loud.

For I will be the first one that you'll see

And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting, drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand

Through this life we've labored hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
So I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come and we'll see paradise

And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout

Tasted a wine that I'll never forget
Opened the doorway and saw through the light
Motions of movement and I felt delight

""A wisdom that took me away from the bed""
Spoke of the glory that we had become
I felt forgiven in all I've become

Cause I don't know if she coming back

Cause ya had dinner waiting
But my boys they were hating
I should of left her alone
Another night on the couch I can not do it

I was caught slipping, damn I was trippin'
My phone wasn't locked but
She found it in the kitchen

"It was a dark and a stormy night
Everyone was at the wing-ding
They weren't the wing-ding type
So they went up on the train bridge
Where the weather was howling
And oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear
The crazy cries of love
They were laughing, they were dancing in the rain
They knew their love was a strong one
When they heard the far off whistle of a train
They were hoping it was going to be a long one
Cuz oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear
The crazy cries of love
In the back booth of an all night cafe
Two dripping raincoats are hanging
Outside in the weather
The shade on the streetlight is clanging
And they smile ear to ear and eye to eye
Ice cream is melting on a piece of pie
Oh, my my
No one else can hear
The cries of love
Every kiss was sweet and strong
Every touch was totally tandem
As the train come a-rumbling along
They sang a lover's song of wild abandon
And oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear
The crazy cries of love
No paper thin walls, no folks above

"Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Outside the school gates
We first met in a basement near the park
(Diamonds in the dark)
We danced all night and then we kissed
Your smile like diamonds in the dark

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

We would have little children
We would be together forever
(Diamonds in the dark)
We would live on Delancy Street
But then you cut your hair and it ended there

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Now I've nothing left to lose
I'm clinging to a cliff-face staring at your shoes
And tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me do you feel the same?
Or are we just waiting to a day we can't
A day that we can't change, we can't change?

And now there's this no man's land
Between you and me
(Diamonds in the dark)
But I still wander in between
The sheets and streets and other places we've been

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Back and back again, back and back again
Back and back again, back and back again
Back and back again, back and back again

No alibis
Get ready for judgement day

You can say it was a game you made
So you must let me go, let me go

Too late - something heard you
Too late - the spell is gone

"Here's to life

No complaints and no regrets
I still believe in chasing dreams and placing bets
But I had learn that all you give is all you get
So give it all you got

I had my fill and drank my share
And even though I'm satisfy I always still
To see what done on other road behind the hill
And do it all again

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
So here's to life
To dreamers and their dreams

Honey, all the times just climes
A love can go from more hellos to sad goodbyes
And live you with the memories you memorized
To keep your winters warm

There is no yes in yesterday
And who knows what tomorrow brings or takes away
As long as I'm still in the game I want to play
For last, for life, for love

And all that's good get better

May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good get better

"I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's heart tonight.
I feel so good I'm going to take someone apart tonight.
They put me in jail for my deviant ways,
Two years, seven months, and sixteen days.
Now I'm back on the street in a purple haze
Chorus:
And I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's heart tonight.
I feel so good I'm going to make somebody's day tonight.
I feel so good I'm going to make somebody pay tonight.
I'm old enough to sin, but I'm too young to vote.
Society been dragging on the tail of my coat
But I've got a suitcase full of fifty-pound notes
And a half-naked woman with her tongue down my throat
They've made me pay for the things I've done.
Now it's my turn to have all the fun
I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's heart tonight..",Folk,Rock

Only once I could see my dream
Didn't feel the smallness under the stars

"On a highway through the desert beneath an overpass Sat two hikers just watchin' cars go by Now one was wearin' sandles with straggly matted hair Rose colored glasses for his eyes Now the other was a cowboy, he'd been down on his luck Lost his money at the Tuscon Rodeo And he sat beside what remained of his trusty pickup truck And like the hippie now he's thumbin' down the road Now some folks don't realize but it's a well know fact Cowboy's and hippies ain't never got along Now was it just coincidence or some weird act of fate That brought these two together on the road? Well they sat there without talking while the morning sun rose high When a hot desert breeze commenced to blow And the fragrance of the incense and six weeks without a bath Finally drifted down and reached the cowboy's nose Well, man that really did it, he couldn't take no more And he tied his old bandana 'round his face Said, ""You greasy stinking hippie you'd put a skunk to shame Boy, you're a discrace to the human race"" Now the hippie he just sat there and gave the cowboy a smile Said, ""Man you don't smell so sweet yourself Well I'm not too sure what that green stuff is on your boots And on your jeans but whew it's enough to make a buzzard belch"" The cowboy said, ""Now listen I ain't gonna that that stuff from you No long haired freak's gonna talk to me that way, get up"" Well the hippie said, ""Now hold on man, what good's that gonna do You know fighting never settles nothing anyway"" Said, ""You know man, in a lot of ways we're an awful lot alike Once you get down beneath the skin Like two books with different covers but the same words inside We're both brothers of the wind"" ""Now we both love our freedom and we'll answer to no man And you've heard it said to thine own self be true We're just a couple of free spirts drifting across the land Doing exactly what we want to do"" Said, ""Now me I got my thing and you, you got yours And I don't see why we can't get along They say the closest thing to freedom is livin' on the road In a country where freedom's almost gone"" Well the cowboy, he just stood up there and never said a word But you know this hippie sure made a lot of sense Well they shook hands and parted as a truck pulled to the side And the hippie he went east and I went west",Country,Folk

"I don't know what day it is
Or if it's dark or fair
Somehow that's just the way it is
And I don't really care

I go to this or that place
I seem alive and well
My head is just a hat place
My breast an empty shell
And I've a faded dream to sell

All alone, all at sea
Why does nobody care for me?
When there's no love to hold my love
Why is my heart so frail
Like a ship without a sail?

Out on the ocean
Sailors can use a chart
I'm on the ocean
Guided by just a lonely heart

Still alone, still at sea
Still there's no one to care for me
When there's no hand to hold my hand
Life is a loveless tale
For a ship without a sail

Still alone, still at sea
Still, there's no one to care for me

With your coffee in the morning makes you so sterile
The corner gang never made a man of me boys

You know the walls are taller and the inmates scheme
There's no one here that's more than seventeen
Bet your life there's a riot tonight in the mess hall

A letter from your home town makes you sad
You read it when the warden's had a second laugh
He said sentimental rubbish ain't got no place in here

See the years roll on by
Such a senseless waste of time
What a way to reform
Call out your number
Who's a nonconformer

Shakey Brown didn't hang around
When a Molotov didn't do it's stuff
He went back in there and said it with a sawed-off
Shotgun

You know Poker Sam couldn't lose a hand
If he did you was hit by a downtown tram
Or crushed in the path of a moving elevator

See the years roll on by
Such a senseless waste of time
What a way to reform
Call out your number

If this old world gives me half a break

There's something in the shadows giving you a fright
Such a gruesome sight
Seeing the children of the night
Destroying humans one by one

No memory of what we've done
Except the signs that we had fun

Now we're waking up with scratches on our back
And flesh underneath our nails
We're going down to Piccadilly Square
To raise a little hell

And now we're on the run
And you know we're having so much fun
Being American werewolves in London

So who's left, who will be next
There's no preference here
Just as long as there's flesh

Look into my eyes
Do you see something to defend
Spinning in the lights
Will I grow old before I die?
Silence is a curse
I feel it breaking the ice
I can see it now
In your eyes you let it fall

Running in a crypt
Of a thousand words
Hiding in the dark
When the violence starts
Looking for a star
We've gone too far
Too far

Don't hide in the dark
Playing shadow games
Turn out the lights
Time for a change
'Cause the devil sleeps in your head

Don't hide in the dark
Playing shadow games
Turn out the lights
Didn't you say we would stay
Til we heard the last
Echo, echo, echo

You got to be the star
You got to beat it

The dark is on your side
You got to beat it",Indie,Electronic
"Love 
Let's catch the wind
An evening breath 
On naked skin
Out where the sun 
Meets the Monterey Sea
A dream / that's as real as can be

On the way 
The day will fade
The blue will shade 
A touch of jade
And make a sight
Very few ever see

Tonight 
When the sky meets the sea 

We can glide 
Though ocean sky
And cover waves 
With ocean eyes
Out where the moon 
Meets the wondering sea
A dream 
That's as real as can be 

And the sea will kiss the sky
And we will fly
And we will fly",Jazz,Jazz
"""I don't know what makes that, that's why I need to you leave!
I'm very busy trying to discover a new science!""

Yeah, beats like this you just can't peep
It's a natural, international, not that same ol' shit
Get split in half, figuratively speaking take a bloodbath
When I run past MC's, drop the mic like the Sunsplash
Is in Jamaica, the heart-breaka lyrics
Like a stake through your left pectoral your shit is horrible
I'm clean, like brand new Mo-Mo's on a Porsche
And your shit is sittin on rims, let me begin
To elaborate, rings on his hands like each finger was Saturn
And the latest fashions but the same patterns
Kept flashin up in his rap, concerned with, glamorous
Tales of fatalities like he was Tarantino
The analogy is that we know that Quentin write Fiction
Fantasies, woven intricately, while I'm predicting
Every motion, them slight changes in your tone of voice
Is a toast to your parasitic choice of speak
Leakin cold blood out the arteries if you bit
'Cause we done said it, you can't configurate
Like the great Hieroglyphics resistance we incinerate
Lit it up, now I'm fin to cut
Peep the demonstration of uniqueness

It could be fatal wait'll Del come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll O come back out, and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts

Hurrah, here come Del to dispel the blahs
Cause and effect, pause for respect collection
Diction friction, depicting violence
Volatile with my profile, like Molotov's
MC's must be on auto-pilot, waddle silent
Like some platypuses, Del is down with data pushers
With top secret floppy disk and battle armor and mega
Plus all the rhymes that I'm bangin are double-decker, to check ya

Electri-fying, defying laws of gravity (what?)
Avidly rapidly firing lyrics I'm shattering
The abdominal cavity, then I'm travelling out the spinal
Finalizing your paralysis on the microphone (what?)
The catalyst is the capital L-I-N-D-S-E-why
MC's try to test but they mind gets blown

Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll Del come back out, and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll O come back out, and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts

Ain't no MC hurtin me, matter of fact you work for me
Havoc stricken palladiums made me numb
To anything you speak to desecrate the great Hieroglyphics
And with it goes the flows that chop egos, to segments
Behind the decimal points, I point backwards
When you lack words you toil but boil I coil clowns
All around, repellin sellin statues of wack groups
Statues for Hieroglyphic travellers
Any lackluster MC's I mallux ya, right on your cranium crack it
Bust your teeth through your limbs and then tip you over
If you know of Del, well then
I ill constantly with consonants, followed by nouns and make
Mounds of manuscripts to whip challengers, that ain't
Too talented, so before I reach my destintation
Let's waste some MC's for fun (yeah)
I understand the fans needs so I feed em smorgasboards
So they can gorge and MC's can gouge they eyes out, from the teargas
Emitted from my tongue, leaving fans sprung
And for the crews who high-strung, eat dung (ewww)
They just gnats and ticks, bugging me (bzzzzzzz)
Hugging me nuts in a cuddly clutch, my
Hieroglyphic theory is validated by facts
Dilated the tracks, so they wide and fat
Violated the wax, but colonized the wise words
With more enzymes ten times nutritional
Unintentional, my flows just go there, yeah

Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll Op come back out and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll Del come back out and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal wait'll Souls come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal wait'll ? come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
It could be fatal... wait'll Cas come back out
Time to scam all you MC's
Yeah, yeah, it could be fatal
Wait'll Pep and Jay-Biz come back out, hahaha

Just wait

A cloud hangs over me, marks every move
Deep in the memory of what once was love

Oh, how I realized I wanted time
Put into perspective, tried so hard to find
Just for one moment I thought I'd got my way
Destiny unfolded, watched it slip away

Excessive flash points beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find
Valueless collection of hopes and past desires

I never realized the lengths I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know
Just for one moment, hearing someone call
Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all

Now that I've realized how it's all gone wrong
Got to find some therapy, treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
Got to find my destiny before it gets too late

"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

"Born the one of a kind mold
And original from one second old, oh
Where did I go wrong?
Somebody let me know

Some choices that I made
Are the reason that I'm in this place today
I'm not where I wanna be
I don't recognize me

So I wanna head back in Your hands
Wanna follow Your plans
Don't wanna be lost no more, maybe a long way home
But I won't make a move till You tell me to

Oh Lord, it's me again
Please don't let my current circumstances
Turn me into a common man
See I just wanna be, be the uncommon me

Oh, this is my prayer today
Oh, I don't ever wanna change
No mistake the way You made me
Wanna be the uncommon me

My reflection kinda had me fooled
I was looking at a man
That I never knew, knew
It was normal to see so I thought it was me

I never meant to change
I'm just glad I realized
Before it was too late, way too late
I need another chance to get back to who I am

So I wanna head back in Your hands
Wanna follow Your plans
Don't wanna be lost no more, maybe a long way home
But I won't make a move till you tell me to

Oh Lord, it's me again
Please don't let my current circumstances
Turn me into a common man
See I just wanna be, be the uncommon me

Oh, this is my prayer today
Oh, I don't ever wanna change
No mistake the way You made me
Wanna be the uncommon me

There are things that are meant to change
Like the seasons and the time of day
But You made me
In the image of You

So until the end of life
To be like You is my one desire
I don't care, Lord, whatever it takes
I'ma get back to the man You made

Oh Lord, it's me again
Please don't let my current circumstances
Turn me into a common man
See I just wanna be, be the uncommon me

Oh, I don't ever wanna change

Like it use to be
Before you fell apart
And you blamed it on me
Back when you were my friend
Do you remember back then
All the plans that we made
Can we get back to thoes days

Thoes days come every now and again
No way I feel like this is the end but

Always is in your eyes
In always I realize
That always is you and I
Always

Let's go back to the start
Like it use to be
Before your broken heart
And your hatred for me
Back when all this began
Do you remember back then
All the plans that we made
Can we get back to thoes days

Always is in your eyes
In always I realize
That always is you and I
Always

Is there any wonder I'm not right
Where do we go now where do we go now
Is there any wonder you won't fight
Where do we go now where do we go now
Have there been to many wrongs to right
I'd say goodbye but

Always is in your eyes
In always I realize
That always is you and I

"I fell asleep late last night
And I dreamed that the night
And almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away

Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away

I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love

And I mean all these words I've said
And you don't have to guess
What's going on inside me head
Just try to know
All the things that our heart says
Listen to love and always
Get love to lead the way

Whenever you love
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love

You know for love I'd go anywhere
(For love) I would go there
(For love, for love) For love to the end of nowhere
And for your love
(And for your love)
I would, I would, I would love
And I would love (would love)

To just spend all my time
With the girl who makes me
Feel her love is mine
Someone you see
Who would only dream of me
She'd be in love
Just because she'd wanna be
She'd wanna be loved

Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far

Thought I'd had enough but I wanted more
So now I'm sneaking out at night
I clean my face and shine my shoes
And go where I'm not supposed to

See I tamed a lion once I stole his roar
Stripped his pride away but he found more
So now he's out to take what's his and shove
My future in my face and scare me back in my place 
So soon so soon you've got it beat 'til it eats you

See I left my flaming sword beside your bed
I woke to find it pressed against my neck
You wept suggestion never works
So now I'm trying something else
I shut my eyes hold on.. oh well
And I felt a feather fall a tree trunk split
Inside my lying mouth played violin
He said you should give up your voice
Before we both end up destroyed

I quit alrigh the purred good boy
You'll fall for anything when you're caught
You'll believe anyone and
I said that's not exactly true
Only you, you do what you do

You awake in the hospital in a thrift store suit
You hear your lover's voice from the waiting room
You shut your eyes and pray for peace
Think I'm not here this isn't me
This isn't something I would do
I know the complicated truth
A big top tent a firey sword
I make a mask of lions roar
But they're not real and never were
And soon she won't be real either
This is the life you went and earned
Because you never fucking learn
You could use up all of your years
Fixing the mess you make in here

Dress heels click off their approach

"It's been a while since we crossed paths
I thought I saw you in an hourglass
I'm not sure where the time is gone
But I know it's been too long
We used to say we'd never change
Now we're trying not to show our age
I know, you said you needed space
So, you moved all the furniture around this place
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
It's getting dark in sunset park
I see the marks on your broken heart
I'm trying not to let it get to me
But it's hard with all our history
Leaving town while the city sleeps
You know, I always had bigger dreams
I keep looking in the rearview mirror
You know, I wasn't happy here
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
Oh, I hate this feeling
You don't feel like home
And now I'm running to you
Trying to find myself
But I don't even know where to start
I can't sit tight as I wait
I've keeping nothing the same
'Cause I don't even know who you are

"Roadkill, guts are spilled
A flattened form of death
A heavenly delight
Death is sweet
Scoop up the meat
Intact or mashed-it matters not

I bring home my new surprises
Open my door, the odor rises
One that makes me feel so good
I feel so fucking high

I smile at my pride and joy on my walls
My pets
Nailed up high and low
By the throat
Intestinal wreath
Rancid beef

My newest tacked up with the rest
I sit back and watch it rot
Breathe deep
Close my eyes
Fantasize that i am one of them",Metal,Indie
"""take me again,"" she said, thinking of him
""to the pond with the swans and the swimming""
Far from his room the familiar perfume
How it felt to her when she was naked
Lessons she learned when her memory slurs
As they marvel with love at the sunset
Walking away at the dark end of day
She will measure and break like a habit
Oh how the rain sounds as light as a lover's word
And now and again she's afraid when the sun returns

""take me again,"" she said, thinking of him
""I don't care for this careful behavior""
A brush through her hair, children kissing upstairs
Keeps her up with her want for her savior
The sun on the sand, on her knees and her hands
As she begs for her fish from the water
But turn them away, she's a whip and a slave
Given time she may find something better
Oh how the rain sounds as loud as a lover's words
And now and again she's afraid when the sun returns",Indie,Folk
"The hour's late and the lights are low
I'm walking home just kicking stones
I waited at the deopt you never showed
You missed the last bus hours ago

I remember the first time
I saw you on the street
You looked so pretty my heart skipped a beat
I can't wait any longer but I still feel the heat

I'm down but I'm still on my feet
I walked on down the old fairground
Up from the docks blew a lonely sound
I sat for a while on the cold hard ground

Watched the stars slowly turn as the earth spun around
As the past falls behind up ahead there's a crack
Of light shining bright through the night so black
Like a runaway train rolling down the track

From here there's no turning back
Listen to me baby
Once upon a time
My heart was an ocean

You swam against the tide
The time is past for grieving
My tears have all run dry
I'll leave you with my love

And now I say goodbye
The bottles broke the glasses are cracked
The cards are all dealt and the chips have been stacked
The lamp shades busted and the curtains are torn

The door keeps knocking but there's nobody home
I stood by the road brushed a tear from my eye
Cursed the cars and the rain and the rolling grey sky
I turned around turned my back on that town

And I never looked back again",Rock,Folk

Too proud to say goodbye
I'm gonna wake up in the mornin'
With a conscience ten feet tall
I'm gonna lay my head down wiser
Or I won't lay down at all

You used to live out on the border
Where no one else could reach
Now I can't ask a question
Without you givin' a speech

Was the one thing I can't do

"Out in the garden, amongst the bushes, Michael is crying.
Caught in a spider's web, its broken wings beating, a butterfly dying.
Oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
And they in their wisdom say
""Michael's got something wrong, wrong, wrong with his mind"".
Well they must be blind, if they can't see what Michael sees.

Michael is silent, talking to no one of things that he sees.
But out in the garden, he talks in soft whispers, like the wind in the leaves.
Oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
And they in their wisdom say
""Michael's got something wrong, wrong, wrong with his mind"".
They've seen the signs, but they can't see what Michael sees.

And inside the building someone is calling his name through the halls.
But he doesn't answer, though he easily hears each leaf as it falls.
Oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
And they in their wisdom say
""Michael's got something wrong, wrong, wrong with his mind"".
Well they must be blind, for they can't see what Michael sees.

Michael where are you ?
Michael where are we,
We who see that there's something wrong with your mind?

And inside the garden Michael is smiling, at peace in his world.
At one with the insects, the flowers, and the trees, and the wind and the birds.
Oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

Oh Michael sees all
Behind the high walls
Surrounding his kingdom,
Whilst we in our wisdom
Still trapped in the spider's web
Far from the flow and ebb
Of life in the garden
But Michael has pardoned
Us for he sees
That really he's free
And there's nothing to mend
For his wings are not broken

And they in their wisdom say
""Michael's got something wrong, wrong, wrong with his mind"".
They've seen the signs, but Michael feels fine inside the garden.

The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain

"Like the seeds of the weeds
In an Autumn wind
We met out in mid air
And fell together
In a patch of ground
And grew to be a pair

But not a pair in the usual sense
As you were much too tall
With curly hair while mine was straight
And I was much to small

We were like interlocking pieces
In the Jigsaw Puzzle of Life

Now the puzzle is faded
Half the pieces are lost
It's limp with ten years wear
Our edges are ragged
And the fit is loose
I guess that we'd best take care

Our scene is pastoral
Naive like our minds
Not fun to be in some times
We want a change from the fields and the skies
And crave some dots or some lines

We were like interlocking pieces

"Your hair hangs in golden steps
You're a bonafide in every respect
You are walking through streets that mean nothing to you
You believe you're above it and I don't really blame you
Maybe that's why you speak like a child,
The things you're saying like ""I'm so free and so wild""
And I believe it when you look in my eyes,
You offer me a life, and never lies
Least only the kind to make me smile

Your clothes are clean and your mind is productive
It shops in store where only the best buy
You're cool and hard, and if I sound like a lecher
It's probably true,
But at least there's no lecture

I really like it when you speak like a child
The crazy sayings like ""I'm so free and so wild""
You have to make a bargain with me now
A promise that you won't change somehow
No way, now how

Spent all day thinking about you
Spent all night coming to terms with it
Time and conditions are built to tame
Nothing lasts with age, so people say
But I will always try to feel the same

I really like it when you speak like a child
I really like it when you speak like a child
The way you hate the homely rank and the file
The way you're so proud to be oh, so free and so wild

I really like it when you speak like a child
I really like it when you speak like a child
I really like it when you speak like a child

"Love bird, you flew into my window
Now in the sticky love nest sits a widow
The tree it fell on all the people
Gathered there to watch it topple

Now turn around, it's burning down
The city we live in
Should we mumble lies?
Take them by surprise?
Let them have their way with us?

Wounds be by old enemies
Broke my heart to see
Foundations ripped apart
And investments fade away
I guess we got off to a bad start

No oxygen
What is the outcome?
Hungry humans 
We've got to enslave them

We'll burn those bridges
When we come to them
I'm not just their leader
I'm also one of them

The food supply has been depleted
The river's ran dry just when it was needed
The rats come out to take it over
Singing, squeaking, ""We built this city""

It's hard to breathe
But we couldn't leave
Nowhere left to go
Almost everybody died
Drank the tears from those who cried
We shriveled from the sodium

And a map was found with an X on it
So we followed it there
And what did we find?
An underground design
As we entered in to our surprise

Oxygen
Rivers of playgrounds ?
The ancients just stayed down
They never stopped moving

We stumbled towards them
But they locked all the barn doors
So we had to dig deeper
We had to dig deeper

And the deep was dark
I wanted to sleep forever
Wake up later, maybe never
We had to build a civilization
Let the planet focus on the planet's rotation

We tried, we tried
We really tried
But no one could do it
Happily alive
Never learned how to survive
We were humans being useless

No oxygen
What is the outcome?
Hungry humans
We've got to enslave them

We'll burn those bridges
When we come to them
I'm not just their leader
I'm also one of them

"You've always been bashful, you're just that way
But your eyes are like billboards, they give you away
Your mouth is a trumpet, somebody else plays
Long after the notes gone, the tone usually stays

And your chest a fine pillow, with lining of feather
Your hair is a family, with strands stick together
Fingers are keys from the grandest piano, played by a line that the Lord only knew

A tongue of an angel, floats in red wine saliva
Your teeth ravel porcelain, made by masters in China
Your face can't be captured by pictures or words
And your voice is a music that I've never heard

And your skin is a cream, dipped out beyond measure
Your nose is a peak never touched by the weather
Your fingers are keys from the grandest piano
Played by a soul that the Lord only knows

Breathe in the palm trees floating by

Friendly but never overbearing
Sold into slavery half a year
The ground we opened up
And it fell in

In place 
Just in cases

Go ahead and grab one

Close all their innocence in flavor
Soaked in the finest herbs we wonder
How could it be so bad
If it tastes so good

You love a polka dot suspender
Bats in the belfry
And the blender
Swimming is religion
When you're on the rocks
It opens up and you fall in

"In this farewell
There's no blood
There's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies
So let mercy come
And wash away
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands
Of uncertainty
So let mercy come
And wash away
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
For what I've done
I'll start again
And whatever pain may come

Yes, I know it's Christmas Eve
And we don't even have a tree
Don't rush to get me a present
Your presence is enough for me
Stay at home, I'll be happy

'Cause I ain't gonna miss something

Holidays make you care enough
To give me gifts, I don't need that stuff
Baby, what I want, you can't wrap it up
'Cause as long as I know I have your love

It's a Merry Christmas, yes, it is
It's a Merry Christmas

No, I'm not Santa Claus
But I wanna spread some Christmas glitter
To someone in a world of need
So extend your love and blessings
To those less fortunate than you and me
Your presence is enough for me

'Cause I ain't gonna miss something
That was never here

Oh, holidays make you care enough

Baby, what I want, you can't wrap it up

That all I did was [Incomprehensible]
Oh, but all those material things
It was just false happiness

So I learned not to put love
After things that you have
Now it's so easy to see
That the best things in life
Should always be free
Why should we pay for something we just don't need?

I told my boss to fuck off, middle finger no peace sign (bitch)

Roll it up go head pass that around
Light it up till they passing out
Flow is rough, go head ask about
Rip up tracks, lap around
Laugh about how we I'm macking now
Herbals out by the pound
Are loud as fuck bitch how that sound?
Drugs out here like gold
I'm representing my home
Marietta I am so blown
So don't let me get in my zone
She's reluctant of my brand, you know these dudes in bands
Like my women like my coffee though, sweet and tan
Shawty, ugh, yup she's falling for it
Jumped on train yup all aboard
I Spit slick like olive oil
But she don't spit she swallow all
She got me
Heart is beating like rocky
I fell in love just stop me
Wait that's probably all of this molly
I need some water; I think I took too much
So somebody call a doctor, I think my heart just stop
But check out my roster, and no this isn't luck
I like my woman like my coffee, hot as fuck

Break time, so break it down
Make time, make you bounce
Take mine, go head make my rounds
Cake time lets make these pounds
Shake down, get you out
Fuck that skirt, loose that blouse
8 times, I think it went down
Wait 9..
I lost count
Ok, ill admit I'm in a daze
Last couple days been a haze
When I blazed everything in my way
Like a rat in a maze and I made it out now bitch I'm amazed
Often baked on my coffee break
Often late when I contemplate
Your talk is great but it's awkwardly

I'm Back at it with a flow so sick
Sick as fuck they don't hope I live
Wordsmith you better hope I miss
I'm High as fuck ayo co pilot
Woodstock like Joan Biaz
Count me out well they so biased
Sleeping on me how dope I is
Fuck all ya'll (Hold My Dick)
Run and tell yo how I kill these beats
They love me up in languages that I don't speak
Ok she was so intrigued I think she's form Belize
So yes you can believe she was screaming (hi papi)
And though it was intense I ain't spoken to her sense

How many times must I call your name?
How many times must I count my wishes?
Count my blessings cause it's all the same to you
Who fill your days
Watching for signs you say
Right time, right people, right place
To leap your walls, let your curtain fall and fly
Go on fly
How many times must you block your self in
With your talk of sin and tired metaphors?
How many times must you pull your self down
Too loaded to walk through the door
To the wide and waiting world?
Go on girl and fly
And when you land you may find
All that's changed is your mind
And that's everything
Open your eyes, you realize
The only difference between fall and flight is you
The only difference between fallen and flight is you
The only difference
The difference is you",Folk,Indie

"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me

This empty house, that don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry
Every once in a while even though goin on
With you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me
What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watchin you walk away
Never knowing, what could have been
And not seein that lovin you
Is what I was tryin to do
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you
Everywhere I go
But I'm doin it
It's hard to force that smile when I see
Our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder gettin up, gettin dressed,
Livin with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved
In my heart that I left unspoken
What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watchin you walk away
Never knowing, what could have been
And not seein that lovin you
Is what I was tryin to do
What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say

"Meet me on the corner of close and soon
I`ll have a song in my head
And my hands on a tune
Nothing lasts forever
So I figure I better
Take you forever
For now

Meet me in the lobby of destiny
I`ll have a ribbon on my shoulders
And a halo over me
If nothing lasts forever
I guess I better
Take you forever
For now

Under a clock
By an information desk
I`ll be there will bells on
By an old oak
A fountain in the park
Just don`t be long

By the ticket counter for love in spring
I`ll be standin` there with cupid
And he can aim that thing
Nothing lasts forever
It`s not a question of whether
I`ll take you forever

"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am

You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
Learned everything from your books on the shelf
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Sophisticated lady take a lesson from me
I can help you be what you want to be
Together we'll see many brighter days
If it takes forever, gonna change your ways

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

"Today started out so atypical, stuck in literal loneliness
I just wanted to keep on sleeping
and quit repeating old arguments
So I came up with my own conspiracy
you will never see through my eyes
'Cause it's making me so frustrated
my faith is fading out over time
I bet that you and I keep sounding like a broken record
I'll forgive you every time
For never stopping once or thinking twice,
never taking time to realise
I'll forgive you every time
For the seconds you let pass away,
will you make it up to me someday?

Would it take a month of Sundays just to tell Him of your sin, If Jesus comes tomorrow, what then? 3.

You entered my soul and gave hope to my life.
So sweet caress, never hope to last!
You left me behind all alone and aghast
Captured inside such an austere Elysium

Love a device against all solitude
As it all went on, the love became
A field in a dream that once had been real
So sweet caress, never long to last!
Destroy this illusion we need a change of fate!
Your frantic thoughts are only a condemned cry

A field in a dream that once had been real

which had never existed

Kids plant a gift for Santa
Milk and cookies by the tree

Way back in the hills
There used to live a mountaineer
They called him Fiddlin' Will
He could play most anything
And some say he could sing
But the one thing that he liked to do best
Was sawing on the strings

So, get out the fiddle
And rosin up the bow
Look at ol' Will a-pattin' his toe
We'll make music till the rafters ring
All that pickin' and a sawin' on the string

When the neighbors had a shindig
And they all had vittles to eat
We'd always have to wait on Will
To make the frolic complete
When he comes down from the mountain
All the gals began to sway
Sometimes he'd pick that ol' five-string
Until the break of day

So tune up the five-string
Tighten up the hide
Tell all the hill folks to get inside
All them pickin' and a-sawing on the string

So tune up the five-string
Tighten up the hide

"What do these marching orders mean?
Some hackneyed fairy tale I'd move outta their dreams
It's what they do
Stepping to
Marching ten paces in front of you

Let's put this countdown clock away
Unfinished parts of the death ray on the lawn
Let them rust, turn to dust
What the heart can't imagine we'll trust

They
They say we can't make this stuff up,
But what else could we make?

What do these marching orders say?
Spelled out in loud forgotten language, they leave
The voice wrecked; don't connect
What the fuse was put there to protect

They
They say we can't make this stuff up,
But what else could we make?

Come on, really lose your voice.
Come on, really lose it.

Stay strong, don't get on with it

On corners
Hurters and the haters and the faders
And the mourners

The world goes to its work and it heads not gentle
And what it breaks you down into

And it's a lone, lone, lone, lonely child
I said that when you met I was just tired
I said it to know, I said it in silence

Young, stay young
And face y'all now, our time to quit
Strong, stay strong
Mind blowing that y'all drum sick

All these hateful people judging and hand bringing
Lord, why don't you bury me in all they call sinning?
Open up your heart, show me the place where love is missing
How long have you been missing love?
I said all creation posing and diving up between them
Now you have to live it up because my head is spinning

I try, try hard
To talk with you
And talk your god
Of love, of trust
Just me and your love

And I call to all my friends
All the cracked could set a thriller
All the hand inside a tiller
And a hundred job a biller
Settled by the stone
I was rejected by the builder
There was drinking out the thought
They carried from the bloody building
Never let it be said that it wasn't really
The shit I know you're missing, girl
Then I'll pass the edges of the earth and make it wider
I see you're crying
Don't you know it's killing me?

I climb, climb up, way up
To see the sun
One, one job
One life, one love
Is all we got

Get tough
Get hard with this

Let it come

My knees hit the floor

"I know sometimes I push you, and say all that I do
To see if you'll still stay
(I like to have my way)
If I took you for granted, just know I never meant to
I try to be thoughtful, and make sure my heart's pure

Good love's hard to hold... That's why I'm squeezing tight

Sometimes I don't feel you, you don't feel me,
We're distant, we need space
But I'm coming back for you, 'cause you're my true blue
You're a Capricorn, I'm Cancer,
And sometimes we can't relate
But we meet at the center, that's where love is tender

You're my first phone call, my best friend, 
You could never be replaced
If I'm not there beside you-
I'm just a hop, skip, a jump a way
I question everything
It's ten years, and I still can't get it straight
Just know that I love you... Always thinking of you!

Good love's hard to hold... That's why I'm squeezing tight
Good love's hard to hold... That's why I'm squeezing tight

I love that you're so truthful, so willing to work it through
You love so brave!
My passion is your flame; I don't want you to change
You kiss me softly undercovers,
And you never make me beg
You even say ""thank you"", and ""sorry"" when you're rude

I love you today in the purest way
I love you today in the purest way

Never, never... never, never... never, never...
Never been so sure before now
Never been so sure before, don't think I could ask for more
Never been so pure

I love you today, in the purest way!",R&B,Pop

"They walk out
And there's no sound
There's a candle burning
Lying up for they to see
The things beyond me

This is why the eyes rise on me
So the nights comes on me
And it starts to breathe 

Tell me what did you think of me?
If I dropped a ring
When you say
When the moon is across the water

Judgment comes when I'm all alone
And the glass door is closed
They heard that it's all left behind

When you talk to me
You could swallow me

That time brings me a place
When I hear your words
I feel you near
Fingers wanted to find a frozen memory

Sometimes close the road
Direction down 
Make you wish you could take it back

I walk in and there's no sound
I walk straight to you
And I find you down
We took a walk where I left you

We want to save
Save now and we won't be punished no more

When you talk to me
You could swallow me 

That time brings me a place
When I hear your words
I feel you near
Fingers wanted to find a frozen memory

But my days they're very blue
Lately things have been changing
Not in your eyes but mine
I've been starting to realize something

I THINK I MAY LIKE YOU
MAYBE MAYBE NOT

But sometimes I think the worst

Whatever it is it's alright
Someone is born and
Someone dies
Something is holding the light

It's standing in the line now

Standing here right now for you

Everything you are now
Creating it right now for you

It's a beautiful day
The sun's coming up
The sun's going down for you
It's a beautiful day
And everyone said the world's turning round for you

There's no need to be afraid
There is no need to deny
That everything is on this way
Life's going on in you mind

"A lifetime waiting for the light to shine
Suddenly you were here, like an angel appeared
And the world that I knew changed into a wonderland
Then you called out my name, Looked around and I found You were gone
Like the rays of the sun, disappeared into never ending nights

Chorus:
Where everything real has turned to stone
And the songbird has flown (you're gone)
Now I know a rose can change a shade of blue
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A shade of blue

My body's hurting, crying and yearning
Sometimes I feel like I'm loosing my mind
And I think about you, knowing only you could understand
Here alone in my room, I can feel all the walls closing in
Feeling trapped in a shell, wishing that I could spin the wheels of change",Jazz,Pop

Were you made ashamed, why'd you lock them in the drawer?

Well I don't think that I ever loved you more
Than when you turned away
When you slammed the door
When you stole the car drove towards Mexico
And you wrote bad checks just to fill your arm

I was young enough I still believed in war
Well let the poets cry themselves to sleep
And all their tearful words could turn back into steam
But me I'm a single cell on a serpents tongue
And there's a muddy field where a garden was
And I'm glad you got away
But I'm still stuck out hear
My clothes are soaking wet from your brothers tears

A silent evil Slithers through the dawn.
Blissful in our ignorance God how could we have known
Today would be the day we learn to mourn?

The Shades of old dictators rise,
Impassive eyes cold hearted.
Watch their 'wunderkinder' try to finish what they started.

The morning sky had barely yielded to the sun's caress,
When from the hills came 'Yellow Wasps' in swarm.
Zvornik wakes discovers what a devil of a mess,
A fragile peace can look when it's been torn.

Now we stand like broken statues 'midst the wreckage of our homes,
Try to recognize our children by the ragsupon their bones.
Out of the 'Cold War' into the ceasefire flame!

[Chorus]
Opened wounds unsettled scores,
An ancient hate new icons.
The front line starts at our back doors
'Cause bygones won't be bygones.
Cleanse the bloodline start the cull,
Nazi roulette six chambers full
Fail to read the warning signs,
Find yourself in Troublesometimes

While common sense had turned it's back
A shadow crossed our nation,
Can mourning mothers veiled in black sing songs of liberation?

"Sitting here wasted and wounded
at this old piano
Trying hard to capture
the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka
still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
they won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up
and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and truth
what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses
Well I'm so far away
step that I takes on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes give each night
to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I just close my eyes and whisper,
baby blind love is true
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on the bed of roses
Well this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked and
She's giving me the eye
Well I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
ooh yeah
Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight won't be alone
To know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses

"Staind - King of All Excuses
You, I trusted your intentions
A trust you took advantage of
Now you are sitting in the hole that you dug around yourself...

You've lied so much you think it's true
Do you know what the truth is?
How does someone get to be like you?
The king of all excuses...
Is she your partner in deception, or caught inside the web you’ve spun?
Did you forget that you were family, the damage you have done...

(Chorus) Oh Carrie I pray one day you'll go back home, To the warmth of Southern Georgia where you belong, And leave all the pain you've felt from me, Here in Missouri. (Verse 2) Oh you were just a young girl, And I swore I could change. Every day that you forgive me, Is just another one you'll waste. You came here in search of something true. I ???? your searching isn't through. (Chorus) (Bridge) It's hard to think that everything around her. To know that won't be happy ever after. (Repeat Chorus x2)",Country,Country

"Some like a night at the movies, some like a dance or a show
Some are content with an evening spent home by the radio
Some like to live for the moment, some like to just reminisce
But whenever I have an evening to spend. just give me one like this

This is a lovely way to spend an evening. can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening, can't think of anyone as lovely as you
A casual stroll through a garden. a kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you

"See I'm a single black male, dark hair, dark eyes
Long walks through a park and a lot of them lives
I'm a little bit shaded by a lot of what I see
So if you're still interested you should come get at me
Cause I'm tired of getting shot down, put down and dissed
I want to be picked up, held tight and kissed
But things like these don't happen to dudes like me
Because I'm more Coldplay than I am Ice-T
They say that good girls love bad guys and that might be
But a bad girl with a good guy, that's unlikely
So what's a man to do to get to hold hands with you?
Do I talk shit and stand and look hard with my crew?
I don't know what to do, so I drown in my drink
It helps to numb the pain, cause when I sit and think about it
Eyes get clouded, thoughts get crowded (thoughts get clouded)
So I'ma sit right here, wait for you to talk about it
In the come on

Said she had a boyfriend, just trying to be nice
But I've heard the same lines from different women all night
Too easy let down, but don't let it get you down
Shit, that's what my boys told me, but end of the night
I was still sitting lonely, if only I could find 'em
Without all the drama, without the one-liners
Excuse me miss, hey mam, you got a man, what's ya name?
I'm in my mid-twenties so enough with the games
Simply put I think you're stunning, and what about some kids?
A couple dogs, a couple cars, a four bedroom crib?
Look, I'm not trying to jib, I'm just speaking from the heart
But we can start with a drink if you want to play it smart
She looking at my boy who got two kids at home and
I know how it goes, here's his number telephone and
He does the girl's turf, and I know you're smelling on him
But every bitch needs a dog, so I guess that's why you want him

I try to be subtle, but even flirting got me shooked
I would never get a smile, all I got was dirty looks
And my self-esteem is low enough, I got teased growing up
And what I do, I beat 'em up, but that only made me tough
It didn't get me girls, or notes in class
Same girls who used to tell, when I would pinch their ass
But if another boy did it, then they would get gritty
So I pretended the handball was their face when I hit it
And I admit it's part the reason why I'm do em like I do
And women in my life, there has only been two
My mother being one, and the other one is done
So my philosophy on dating is; ain't no fun
Cause they come and they go, and even if they don't cum
They still have to go, girl I give the best head
But you just wouldn't know, cause you stuck up in some diddy
But even if you dissed me, I ain't mad",Pop,Hip-Hop

"You want to know just like before
Well I don't really think you need our fucking explanation
For how we read and how we write
Too much of that is a social abomination

And death becomes your one reality
It's outta my hand what you think of me
Let's rip down this enterprise so

Why don't we wrong the right

Take two steps back and three more forward fuck
All your lie and this bitch I can't afford
Too much is gone its such a waste
Too much of that now I fucking lost my taste",Indie,Electronic

"My soul is freezing 
I fear to see another day 
Another day that is filled with this emptiness 

Just in darkness I can take my breath 
Oh, and I think that even darkness is gone 
Hell in my soul with hundreds of torturing demons 
All my hope seems to be like sand 
Never well-kept in my shivering hands 
Never stop running down from my fingers 
Alone in the dark I just howl for the moon 

Bleeding heart inside me 
Light of sanity is gone 
I think that I am lost 
No one close that could be with me 
No one close that could be just me 
I used to have one of nocturnal beauty 
Killer of pain, the one that kissed 
Kissed in the way that I could kill for 
Anything, anyone; except the one 

Misery, agony, dark pain is ripping my soul
Desperation, depression, all light is gone
Torment, death, reaper's blade is close
Sadness, darkness, you fill my soul with those

Cliff is close, sinister feeling
The overdose of darkness creeping
For all those demons who tear

My own soul which is filled with fear
I welter in pain, come, hold me tight
I wish the gain from touch of the night
The one that I care I'd like to return
Once more to share the warmth of the flames that burn

The darkness is tearing and ripping inside
The light of sanity is leaving my mind
I think that I will go insane
I run in night can't stay in light of day

Is this my final destiny
To cross the river of death
Through the bridge that mortal walks just once
Just once, just once, .. no more",Metal,Metal
"It’s poetry carved in flesh
This beautiful hell of ours
To the deadliest sin we confess
And tears of joy fill our eyes
We are safe where disfigured saints
Cry out their prophecies of doom
My heart’s a graveyard baby
And to evil we make love
On our passion’s killing floor
In my arms you won’t sleep safely
And of lust we are reborn
On our passion’s killing floor
At the first kiss the seeds of hatred are sown
And back into darkness we flee to tear our hearts out
We are safe where all faiths fail
Alive inside of our tomb",Indie,Metal

about burning out so young 
When you accessorise with bruises on your cheek 
and cool tricks of the tongue 
You're spending Saturday alone drowning heartache out

And sometimes you'll just slip away

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival",Rock,Folk

So when the world turns its back on you
Keep in mind that it has turned on me too
If you're hopeless standing next to me
Then hell can collect me

There is something here

If you're here to take my heart from me
Take it fast before my mind can see
If you're here to take my heart from me
Take it fast before my mind can see

"Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long While there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrong When death has come and taken our loved ones, it leaves our home so lonely and dreary Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year Farther along we'll know all about it; farther along we'll understand why Cheer up, my brother; live in the sunshine, we'll understand it all by and by Faithful till death said our loving master; a few more days to labor and wait Toils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful gates Farther along we'll know all about it...

"I'm a man of God
Though I never learned to pray
Walked the pathways of the heart
Found him there along the way

And I am, yes I am, I'm a man of faith
And faith is something you can't see
But if we want to make it through
Faith is how it's got to be

I'm thanking you Lord for giving me song
For making me strong
And for taking my hand
I'll go up to heaven when I reach the end
But up until then
Gonna do what I can

And I can, yes I can be a man of peace
Plant it like a tiny seed
It grows a little when you give
And gives you back when you're in need

No I am, yes I am, I'm a man of song
Gonna sing it far and near
Gonna make a joyful sound
One that every heart can hear

Singing for Him is like touching the sky
I don't need to know why
I just know that it is

Each time I sing out I want to rejoice
'Cause when I hear my voice
I believe that it's His

And I am, yes I am, I'm a man of hope.
I haven't stopped believin' yet
And while we're headin' down that road
Hope is what we can't forget

And I am yes I am, I'm a man of God
Know I am, yes I am, I'm a man, I'm a man of faith

"Lord,I really don't know how to write a song.
I'm not always eloquent, sometimes I get it wrong.
But the thing you're doing in me, I can't describe.
What a fool I'd be if I chose to hide
this transformation, new motivation.
Thought that we were close; I've known you all this time.
But I was just living life my way, just getting by.
Thought that if I do a good deed or two,
that'd be enough to please you.
I kept the parts I wanted to,
and missed out on the real you.

[Chorus]
Now, with every step and every breath,
I give it all; hold nothing back.
With all I am, this is my choice
to live to worship you.
So, with all my heart, my soul, my mind;
I'll love you, leave it all behind.
To live my life in awe of you
is the least that I can do.

I've held on so long to all my hopes and dreams.
While you were asking me to place them all at your feet.
Let my praise be more than a song I'll sing for you.
Let me change all my ways in response to you.
I've lived for myself, Lord, I need your help.
Not I who lives, but You.

[Chorus]

For you are worthy of all honor.
(and you) deserve the sacrifice I'll give.
You've touched my heart, and now I see
what it is you want from me.
So I'll lose the things that hold me back,
so you can set me free.

"Emotions crucified from the beginning of time
Condemned, not knowing what's my crime
The dreams that ever grew in my mind
Has risen to hatred beyond mankind
Obsessed thoughts are choking me
No one else will ever see
So alone, so cut off, so lost
Have to be free, whatever it will cost
I'm falling below mental darkness
The demons taking control over my head
Won't ever leave me until I'm dead
Insanity eating me from inside
Nowhere to go, now here to hide
I'm forced to give vent to the rage
That has grown in me since early age

[Lead: Malmstrom]

Blinded by obstructed imagination
My conscious is reaching the twilight
Erasing the difference between wrong and right
You don't see what I see
Frenetic visions that will never set me free
My world will never be like yours
Greedy lust took me off the course
Trapped in a sadistic desire
That burns my mind like fire
Frustrated by darkness devouring my past
Only the terrifying memories will last
I'm falling below mental darkness
The demons taking control over my head
Won't ever leave me until I'm dead

Nowhere to go, now here to hide

Can you cut behind the mystery

This feeling has me spellbound.
Yet the story line in paragraphs laid down the same.
In fathoms of my inner mind I'm mistified, oh, by this mood.

This melancholy feeling just don't do no good.
Come here my love.
And I will lift my spirits high for you.
I'd like to fly away and spend a day or two.

Just contemplate the fields and leaves talking about nothing.
Just laying down in shades of effervescent, effervescent
Colors and shades of time and tide. 
And flowing through. 

Become enraptured by the sights and sounds in intrigue of nature and beauty.
Come along with me and take it all with you.

When the nights all feel like they're running together

Across the miles so far from home
All I find roads that ramble on and on and on
There's a life, there's a life that I'm missin'
So much more than I can see
There's a life, there's a life that I'm chasin'
That always stays one step ahead of me
Out of reach but I know that I'm getting closer
I believe that as long as I breathe that the dream's never over
Inside myself I try to find a way to keep this hope alive

Through good and bad times
It's kept me growing

For fortune is a fleeting time
And no one knows what time may bring

The one thing I've been living for

"Dave Mustaine

Each day my shortcomings pick my pockets
My faults were letters carved in stone
As meaningful to you as words written in water
I'm left to walk this world alone
Fill solos - Mustaine
In a broken mold they made me
The black sheep of the family
Worth less than zero my opinion
And room temperature IQ
I did something, now I'm nothing
Always wrong with this or that
Poisoned with fear watch it twist
My measly brain mad
Solo - Pitrelli
Talk about me when my bac is turned
Next time we meet it will be to late
The memory burned in my ears of what you said
And now I've got a recipe for hate
Taste it
Fill solos - Mustaine
Dark clouds on the horizon
Make it hard to breathe
A walking mistake but every time
I run away, I just come back for more
The choice is clear I can quit
And fall on my sword or light a fire
To see who runs or stays
And plays the confidence game
Solo - Pitrelli

...Warhorse
I'm feeling quite invisible
I feel just like thin air
The truth taunts me
Solo - Mustaine
I see the earth below me
I watch it spinning there
Does someone, somewhere
Out there hear me?

Sentenced to walk in Purgatory
My life is running down
I can't believe what they've done to me

Did some harm.

And it almost kept me warm,

Where that lamb fell down

Was I supposed to praise my Lord,
Make some kind of joyful sound?

"When all that's left to do 
Is reflect on what's been done 
This is where sadness breaths 
The sadness of everyone 

Just like when the guys built the 
Dam at otter creek and all the 
Water backed up 
Deep enough to dive 

We took the dead man in sheets 
To the river flanked by love 
Deep enough to dive 
Deep enough to dive 

Be here now 
We took him there and three 
In a stretcher made from trees 
That had passed in the storm 

Leave the hearse behind 
To leave the curse 
Be here now",R&B,Indie

"Some people love New York
Leave everything to be there
Their dreams get lost or found
Get left behind or go somewhere

Give me the simple things
A fire in the hearth
And space to spread my wings
See children playing when they're young

Some people love and leave
To be near all the movie stars
Sit in cafes all day
Discovered for the perfect part

Give me my piano lamp
A glass of wine for my friend
We'll laugh the night away
And sing the same old songs, again.",Folk,Jazz

"In the hand of God there's a cattle prod 
That keeps shocking us along 
Until we're flung from roofs without parachutes 
Filling patches on His lawn

And there's an iron gate where patrolmen wait 
To keep the chosen people safe
From the infidels in their terror cells
Rifles blessed by God's good grace

And there's a shining path strewn with shattered glass 
And hemmed in with barbed wire
So you can skim your feet but you can't come free 
Oh hallelujah higher and higher

And all those foxhole prayers full of fear you share 
With a bored and and distant son
While you held your will while killing time until 
Answers came for anyone

And you curse their Lord for all He ignored 
In His flawed and vengeful plan 
Cut yourself some slack against a deck so stacked
I mean come on now you're just one man

And maybe after all when your conscience calls
You might prove the missing link
And all that white hot air you sprayed around out there
Might have meant more than you think

So when you breathe, breathe deep
Breathe in greedily like you might never breathe again
Go and tell the truth of all the work you do
It won't be worthless in the end",Indie,Folk

When I lay down my fears My hopes and my doubts The rings on my fingers And the keys to my house With no hard feelings When the sun hangs low in the west And the light in my chest Won't be kept held at bay any longer When the jealousy fades away And it's ash and dust for cash and lust And it's just hallelujah And love in thoughts and love in the words Love in the songs they sing in the church And no hard feelings Lord knows they haven't done Much good for anyone Kept me afraid and cold With so much to have and hold Mmh When my body won't hold me anymore And it finally lets me free Where will I go? Will the trade winds take me south Through Georgia grain or tropical rain Or snow from the heavens? Will I join with the ocean blue Or run into the savior true And shake hands laughing And walk through the night Straight to the light Holding the love I've known in my life And no hard feelings Lord knows they haven't done Much good for anyone Kept me afraid and cold With so much to have and hold Under the curving sky I'm finally learning why It matters for me and you To say it and mean it too For life and its loveliness And all of its ugliness Good as it's been to me I have no enemies I have no enemies I have no enemies I have no enemies,Country,Country

On this bright blue marble orbited by trash
Man, there's no beating that
It was no big thing to give up the way of life we had

Oh ho oh

My social life is now quite a bit less hectic
The nightlife and the protests are pretty scarce
Now I mostly spend the long days walking through the city
Empty as a tomb
Sometimes I miss the top of the food chain
But what a perfect afternoon

Industry and commerce toppled to their knees
The gears of progress halted
The underclass set free
The super-ego shatters with our ideologies
The obscene injunction to enjoy life
Disappears as in a dream
And as we return to our native state
To our primal scene
The temperature, it started dropping
The ice floes began to freeze

From time to time we all get a bit restless
With no one advertising to us constantly
But the tribe at the former airport
Some nights has meat and dancing
If you don't mind gathering and hunting
We're all still pretty good at eating on the run
Things it would have been helpful to know before the revolution

Though I'll admit some degree of resentment
For the sudden lack of convenience around here
But there are some visionaries among us developing some products
To aid us in our struggle to survive

On this godless rock that refuses to die",Indie,Indie

"The sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming The sweetest days are the days that used to be The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting When you said, ""Sweetheart, remember me"" Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming Remember me at the close of a long long day It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming just to know you still remember me You told me once that you were mine alone forever And I was yours till the end of eternity But all those vows are broken now And we will never be the same except in memory Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming Remember me at the close of a long long day It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming just to know you still remember me A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear A sweeter smile and a love more bold and free But in the end fairweather friends may break your heart, dear If they do sweetheart remember me Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming Remember me at the close of a long long day It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming just to know you still remember me",Country,Jazz

Knows the one I love: 
Sweet Sue - just you! 

And the moon on high, baby,

Sweet Sue - is you!

Without you I don't know what I'd do.

Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year

Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share

Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Christmas time is here
Families growing near
Oh that we could always see
Such spirit through the year

"Well he lit you up
like Amber Waves in his movie show
He fixed you up real good
till I don't know you anymore
from Ballet Class to a Lap Dance
Straight to video
And the pool side news
was that he would be
launching you
Into every young man's
Bedroom - you gave it up
on DVD and magazine -
you gave it up
a private rite of passage
you gave it up
to every boy's sweet dream
with their paper cuts
You said ""he's got a
Healing Machine
it glows in the dark
glows in the dark""
You say ""there's not a lot
of me
left anymore -
just leave it alone.
But if you're by and you have
the time, tell the Northern
Lights to keep shining - Lately it
seems like they're drowning""
He could light you up
and summon every swan
to the Lakeside
Off to Cabo San Lucas
for some optical stimulus
Then you started to guess
there was someone else
though His flint glass
seeing all of you
immersed in his sepia
Into every young man's
Bedroom - you gave it up
on DVD and magazine -
you gave it up

you gave it up

"""Bah, humbug!"" No, that's too strong
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from
Last year, ski shop,
Encounter, most interesting.
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines.
So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer,
I just need to catch my breath,
Christmas by myself this year.
Calendar picture, frozen landscape,
Chilled this room for twenty-four days,
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!
Flashback to springtime, saw him again,
Would've been good to go for lunch,
Couldn't agree when we were both free,
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.
Didn't, of course, 'til summertime,
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No, this time it was me,
Sunburn in the third degree.
Now the calendar's just one page
And, of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year.
Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites.
Last fall I had a night to myself,
Same guy called, halloween party,
Waited all night for him to show,
This time his car wouldn't go,
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late,
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way, unwind
Doing Christmas right this time.
A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?
So on with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery,
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!
""I'm spending this one alone,"" he said.
""Need a break; this year's been crazy.""
I said, ""Me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending! ""

Couldn't miss this one this year!",Pop,Pop

"Reaching for sour grapes
Reaching for sour grapes
If I can't taste and get my fill
Then no one will
If I can't touch, if I can't touch you
I don't know what to do

Feels like we're both in love
Wedding bells ring above
And I need love more than anyone
I'm the prodigal son
And I need love, but the more I see love
The more I need love

You reach me unequipped
For the tenderness you bring
You cannot leave tonight
Just to give your disguises away

All your words of wanting
Are somewhere in love's ?
A powerful tool
A pleasant smile, an excuse for love

Looked in the mirror today
Then I got scared away
Oh I need love
No affection for my reflection
Oh I need love
'Cause I can't guilt it, never forgive myself

You reach me unequipped
For the tenderness you bring
It tastes like sour ?
And it feels like a terrible waste

Before you know I was happy on my own

"Jen is bringing the drugs. 
She wants to get real fucked up. 
She used to laugh and smile, 
But the years of denial. 
Have taken their toll on her dial. 

But, me, I do as I please. 
I caught you and set you free. 
Cause I have been left alone by the people I've known. 
And I don't know when they're coming home. 

And Jen don't wanna be seen, 
But I saw her in a swank magazine. 
She had an airbrushed face, 
But the lines of distaste 
were crossed without crossing of legs. 

And I don't wanna be found. 
So when you get home, 
I'm skipping town. 
I'm leaving to go someplace 
where nobody will have any clue where I am.

London Danny is a real bad penny
The one man time has told me I should fear
For the girl you left behind, she said she would be mine
So why did you have to come and show your face round here


For she always said that time would make it right
But now I always hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Ah but please now don't you take her from me, London Danny

Well I've learned to listen for your name round town
Whe people talk of your success in city life
But I could never tell if she heard them talk as well
Or rue the day she ever was a poor man's wife

For she always said that time would make it right
But now I always hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Ah but please now don't you take her from me, London Danny

Well me' hands are black while yours are clean and clever
There's ways you know to turn her pretty head
Well its all that I can do when me' working day is through
To let her heart beat me to sleep each night in bed


For she always said that time would make it right
But now I always hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Ah but please now don't you take her from me, London Danny

Well London Danny you're a real bad penny
The one man time has told me I should fear
For the girl you left behind, she said she would be mine
So why did you have to come and show your face round here


For she always said that time would make it right
But now I always hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go

Your touch is like cocoa butter on my heart
Oh oh your kiss is like cocoa butter on my heart
Oh, boy, you are like cocoa butter on my heart

My heart was bruised, that's what happens when you use it
Ready for someone that turned it all black and blue it
Been that way for so long the sight became familiar
And then your love came in just like a natural healer

You've got a way of making it all okay
You make it okay

Your love is like cocoa butter on my heart
Your touch is like cocoa butter on my heart
Oh oh your kiss is like cocoa butter on my heart
Oh, boy, you are like cocoa butter on my heart

I show you my burns, you show me lessons learned
I show you my scars, you show me works of art
I show you a blemish, you show me God's not finished
With every imperfection you showed me your blessing

You've got a way of making it all okay
You make it okay

Cocoa butter on my heart
Oh your love is like cocoa butter on my heart
Oh oh your kiss is like cocoa butter on my heart
Oh, boy, you are like cocoa butter on my heart

Rub it in, I know you missing more,
You rub it in with your wisdom
Oh, rub it in with a kind word
When you rub it in your love because

Your love is like cocoa butter on my heart
Cocoa butter on my heart

You forgot about our destiny

You fell from me

I was amazing to you

"Eyes that send me
Chasing after feelings that I lost one day
Why befriend me, when the brandy tells me
What they want to say
Playing big protector is a grand disguise
Till you contradict yourself with brandy eyes.
No beginning, still no end to let me shrug and walk away
Silly grinning, teasing talking promise of a kiss someday
I would put you out of mind if I were wise
But wisdom has no power over brandy eyes.
Maybe I'm wrong
If I am please pardon me and pat my head
Sing an old song, sing of one more foolish heart
That's been mislead
Take the points for winning and donate the prize
And keep right on a-scoring with those brandy eyes.",Folk,Jazz

"Ollie told me I'm a fool. 
So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, 
And what do you think he said to me?

[Chorus]
When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie showed me the fork in the road.
You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

[Chorus]

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard it when I was very small.

[Chorus]

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, 
My old car froze up last night. 
Ain't no reason to hang your head 
I could wake up in the mornin' dead.

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam

"After the ceasefire that they swore would last
She had the bright idea: ""To hell with the past!""
That's where love lay bleeding, licking at its wounds
The times were never changing, sticking to their guns
She thought she really meant it, that's the honest truth
She felt it in her marrow, she felt it in her boots
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire

The man she married, he was something else
He adored the chaos, smashing all the delft
The man she married, he was something else
He had the sudden notion it's time to call a truce
It's time to lead a quiet life for the love of Jesus
Let's sit down together, and engage in talks of peace
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire

He was Irish Catholic, she had English blood
They met in a good restaurant, they gave the secret nod
She ordered fish and lentils, he the kidney stew
She played with bold impulses, wine turned his lips blue
They left in separate taxis to the same address
In case someone was watching, and there they did confess
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire

It was all the others' fault, they thought at any rate
After the ceasefire to put an end to hate
She was reaching for her knife, he a fork and spoon
They sat about devouring the poison of the moon
Shared a fatal cigarette neither one would light
Their breath was flame enough, nobody said goodnight
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire

After the ceasefire that they swore would last
They had the strange idea of living in the past
That's where love lies bleeding, licking at its wounds
The times are never changing, sticking to their guns
They sit about devouring the poison of the moon
The times were never singing the same tune

He knows when you're a wake

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

You are such a star, oh, you know you are
I just once looked through today
Had the mind to call your name, internally
Through my seventh sense that's hallucinating
Anyway we're artifacts of demigodly zero logic denizens

I just came in your arms tonight.
You and I are friends, not some polemic
To be puzzled over, listened
They set my wings so randomly
When you're dead I'll search for you like Orpheus
I'll find you, some way

You are such a star, oh, you know you are
I'll tell you one thing
I know you want my kisses in your narcissistic collapse
Because it's so painful when they amputate the taygog

See all the prison corpses lined up along beach
They're ringing the bells of the church to drive everybody insane
As the patina lives the tawdy mountain stallion on its water on the shore

I can't get off of these moving lights off the face
No, I can't get all those little moving lights off the face
So I went out to the country, sat down on some straw

But I'm not putting out for God tonight
I'm not putting out for God would kill my legs shut, shut
It's a mistake lighting little white candles to make him love you
Oh, he's cold by any city's standards

They want to turn you down
Dismissed
How 'bout if all you children and Tayshuns
No

"[Chorus: x2]
Swollen Members gunna make us stop
Take a minute and remember who takes the top
To the critics and the civils your time is up
Just admit it everybody knows this crime is up
Its hot shit

Perfected but not invented
Rhymes from the ego driven self centered
Entered the fast lane and never gut dented
Life in a flash hypes blunts and hash
Three of my favorite word has made this
More hits than the majors up from the minors
Bust from the top dot cops and sirens
Fresh out the shop poppin' n' stylin'

Madchild, wildin' nonidentical
The cynical is medical condition is critical
Unforgettable Swollen Members beautiful
Language unsuitable tention n' onic
Coastal Chronic track got Moka on it
Independent with a different perspective
Select effective next (scratch sound) on exit
The young and the restless fool fuel injected

[Chorus: x2]

Y'all ain't got it so don't even think about it
'cause I'm tough if ya know the top
Swollen Members, Moka Only gonna take the shot
If you think you betcha know you better press for why
You can mop it in your song and repossess your mind
If you front it you can blow or you can testify
Someone else was about what it takes to climb
Whenever battle axe warriors come out to play
You can bet we gonna do it in a thousand way
And we sweating off the duel we resuscitate
Members only rock, shit, motherfucker bait, its hot shit

How many albums bought n sold
Triple ghetto gold rocked and rolled
Sound, mixed and mastiff
Stick with the program, get payed after
TV shows, zeens and magz
Positive feedback, jeans still sagged
Hands still knocked, Prevails gets props
The same as always rising to the top

With the sworm of excitement
Fighting form we invite criticism
Rhyme shine like prism
Spit flames we see in 3D vision
Even my people play CD in prison
Bad decision, fatal error
Get scars from bars and bomb every terror
We own label never get dropped
Now the crew combined and we can't be stopped

What did you give Give to the man Mind that can only fell'n'suffer Heart made with With daub smiles Meaningless words And bottomless torment. What did you give to the man when he with bowed head With storm of feelings'n'passions Dives in the whirl of existence. Is it not to much? Can we stand that whatt a grace is? On the rough wave Of the seeming might Full of the pride Cruel words as the weapon. When one blow One blow changes mighty'n'rapid river In the slime of the swamp. When the end of Dream 'bout life Is so fast Fast like cu of knife. When hedies like an animal With hate'n'fear in his eyes He'll tear you heart out if That will give him his life back.,Metal,Folk

"I found a mark
Where the ink bled through
Under a song
I was writing for you
Crumpled up in a drawer
Stained with blue
Quiet and easy
What I wanted to prove

The plainest thing
The plainest thing
I walk right by it
It's just the plainest thing

The sun hits the floor
Same as the shadows will
So I sat in the light
I stayed very still
Heat on my skin
Bright on my face
I didn't have any questions
I didn't feel out of place

The plainest thing
The plainest thing
I forgot about it
It's just the plainest thing

I don't know how it works
I don't know how to say
I was thinking bout us
It's just the plainest thing",Folk,Indie
"You watch them watch you
You want them too
Then their faces fade away

You worked your whole life
To show them all that you have what it takes to shine

Cause no one has what you have
And no one ever will
You have heart
And that's all you need

You're gonna shine for them
Shine for them
Shine
No matter what it takes you'll shine

Well life got complicated
And no one ever waited
And you son grew into a man
And all you wanted was to be loved
But it ended up fitting you like some glove
Was strangling all your changes to shine

But you'd show them all
That you'd make them fall
Cause they didn't understand a thing about
The way you'd shine
Oh you shine

Your gonna shine for them
Shine for them
Shine
No matter what it took you shine

Now you're on the best stage
And in your best dress
But the show is not for you
It's a clown with a frown
In from out of town
And your hairdo's falling
And they're filling out and
My God the clown is you

But you dance for someone that smiles at you
And drift into the shadows of yourself
Off you go

But you shine for him
Shine for him
Shine
And now its time for them to shine for you

Shine for them
Shine for them

"I sit around and watch the tube but, nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fucking lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

I got no motivation
Where is my motivation
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration

I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun
You're fucking lonely

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Slipping away to paradise
Some say, quit or I'll go blind
But it's just a myth",Pop,Indie

Ruthless - stealing territories from our hands
Anger throwing down the victims to the ground
Cold blood younger soldiers

Flag poles threading down
the freedom of our men
Innocence dying by the fury of the sword

Now I'm rich rich rich

To da bently from da cutlass
Now dey pissed pissed pissed

We blowin purp in da front
Dey pourin yak in da back

A couple gats in da back
And ain't none of us gon rat

If I ain't already ripped them
My brother Boosie done flipped them

We got high like a missile
And we be clean like whistle

I lay dat dick a winner
Just ask my girls in Virginia 
The just can't stand when its all up the screen in the center

I be wit Pimp, we be pimpin
San Francesco to Memphis 

I cut the baddest lil bitches 
And if you get when I'm finished

I just talk lil shit
And its a hit when I'm finished

Drop the top when its pretty
Pop the six in a minute 
Savage Life don?t forget it 
Trill Fam in da building 

We gon need some more space 
'cause money stacked to da ceiling 

(Chorus)

Big gangsta since double Guinness

we'll just put up some bleachers out in the sun

She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair

What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

It's not somebody who's seen the light

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again

Check it out
 
I'm just sittin', smokin' weed and looking at some old pictures
From mom's house of when I was a young boy (When I was a young boy)
And the first one that I see is of me and Melinda
On the roof throwin' gang signs
The kind of homie that you don't find
But she always kept things on her mind
She never was my baby, we had a crush
When we were younger
We used to hump and that was it
No bullshit, she was eleven, I was ten
But she meant more to me than any woman since

[Chorus:]
Remember Melinda
I used to stay across the street from her
She could have been a supermodel
Don't remember doing shit without her
I often think about her
Remember Melinda
Never really found her way home
I loved her like my sister
Dear Lord I really miss her, one wish
Long as I live, I'll always remember Melinda

She always had a lot of drama
Watchin' daddy drunk, beating on mama
She used to stuff grams in her bra for my nigga Rob
Twistin' niggas was her job, married to the mob
I used to take her on runs with me
She'd sit in the passenger seat and count the funds for me
It's my fault, I introduced her to the game
To find out she couldn't hang, and it's a shame
That I remember when she started actin' crazily
Was first day she brought my yay to me
Let's get some yack because you made me now
The first lick is about to get paid now
But wait up, what's the deal why ain't you happy
Something's wrong and that's real an open package
That's when I finally realize
Melinda getting high off of my supply!

[Chorus]

And no I'll never forget the night
Her nose started bleeding, her eyes turned white
And I can't get it out of my mind
I'm telling you I still remember, yes I remember
12:30 on the dot here come the doc
The news he's bringing me, I'm shocked
Another victim, and I done made my self a killing
All for the love of drug dealing

Remember Melinda

"Shane and Dixie they were two-bit crooks
They wanted to be famous like you read in books

As a bank robber Shane really hadn't got a clue
He'd end up likely at the end of a noose
Which was fine by Shane if the papers could use the story

Fame and love, fame and love
Fame and love will never die
Shane said to Dixie, we're getting nowhere
But I've a fine idea if you love me, swear
We'll be household names if we only dare, forever
Here's two bullets in my old carbine
One is yours and the other is mine
Then we'll be happy till the end of time together

She tears her hair
Saying, Shane this time
You've lost your mind

And Dixie lay dying down there on the floor
Shane was shaken but his purpose was more inspired
Shane said, Lord what have I done
But this victory is only halfway won
Then he put the barrel underneath his tongue and fired

[CHORUS]
They found the bodies when the neighbours complained
Shane was all over the walls like paint
Dixie looked bad but her heart beat faint but surely
Well they saved her life, they were just in time
And she turned her back on a life of crime
And she married the man who came to type out her story
O the news of the screws most generously gave
The money helped to pay for Shane's new grave
And it looked so fine till the vandals sprayed it over
Time went by and the weeds grew high
And hid Shane's grave from the curious eye
And maybe that's why we forget those lines he told her

"The steps he took were nice and easy.
He never knew he could stumble and go down.
As he saw the buildings and the mountains crumble,
Over the road he would take to the town.
He said, ""Next year I'm coming back, I'll see you later.""
It takes longer when you're far away.

There's a tale which says he was pursued by an assassin.
What he knows of that, no-one can tell.
How close he came to the trapper,
But he stopped by a wishing well.
He said, ""Next year there will be many flowers,
Each one much brighter than the one before.""

As he turned he caught the feeling,
And he smiled as he walked down the road.
All my days they are filled with meaning,
But I have yet to fathom the code.
But next year I'll call the tune and it won't be easy,
The timing's all out of place with how you feel.

Next year I'm coming back, I'll see you later.
It takes longer when you are far away.

Each one much brighter than the one before.

"You said to me I'm not what your looking for
Your movin' on somebody else can give you more
So I let you go thinking will never meet again
But here you are and baby I wanna know

Did you wanna be rich did you wanna feel special
Did you wonder in all this time how I
Was livin' without you
Did you wanna be cruel did you think that I never would go on
Now all the things you thought you had have gone
Let that be a lesson to you

Its funny how life can change
You never know until you walk away
I see you now and your lost and afraid
Because you know had love
And you wanted more

I give your more than I ever got back
You left me here to forget about that
Have gone

Your special your so special your so special to me
All things that you wanted now you know were wrong
You gave up love for something more let that be a lesson to you",Metal,Country

Because the words you say they hurt her.

Listen! It's hard to be a man,
You could never fall off of your pose
Have your emotions, keep your enemies close
And the ones we love the most they never know it
'Cause he get all cut up, chasin' paper and never show it,
But she'll stay up and wait, for you to walk in late
Then ask you, where you been, now here we go again
When she know that you've been out hustling,
But you don't think like arguing I'm fussing, no

Oh no no,
No, just put that hand back there ain't no need for that
And that's for real, real, for real
My words last for days, just tell her how you feel

Can't make excuses, you'll get put to the test
Can't think and drink just a mile out the voices,

Before you knew it, now you got the cops outside your door

The air was sweet like honey; 
The grass was soft we made
A pledge to keep on running.
The clouds were shied away,

You ripped my heart away.

You'll get it, regret it
Take my advice!

Now what are we becoming?
Outside the blackbirds sing, 
But you keep down the blinds, 
'Cause each time you kiss her lips
They'll sing my lullaby.

Now we are sober and cold
And there's no way to return,

"If the elephants have past lives, yet are destined to always remember,
It's no wonder how they scream,
Like you and I, they must have some temper.
And I am dreaming of them on the plains, dirtying up their beds,
Watching for some kind of rain to cool their hot heads.
And how dare that you send me that card when I'm doing all that I can do.
You are forcing me to remember when all I want is to just forget you.
If the tiger shall protect her young, then tell me how did you slip by.
All my instincts have failed me for once, I must have somehow slept the whole night.

And I am dreaming of them with their kill, tearing it all apart,
Blood dripping from their lips, and teeth sinking in too hearts.
And how dare that you say you will call, when you know I need some peace of mind..
If you had to take sides with the animals, won't you do it with one who is kind?

If the hawks in the trees need the dead, if you're living you don't stand a chance.
You can lie there and say you are fed, but there are only two ends to this dance.
You can flee with your wounds just in time, or lie there as he feeds,
Watching yourself ripped to shreds and laughing as you bleed.

So for those of you falling in love, keep it kind, keep it good, keep it right.
Throw yourself in the midst of danger, but keep one eye open at night.",Pop,Indie

Run to me and I'll pretend
A love like ours should never end -
And you should know I'll never let you down.
Whenever you're in trouble
You can run to me
Forget your prive
My broken heart I'll try to hide.
So if you need my love and sympathy -
You run to me.
Should it be you lose your destiny
It's no one there to comfort you.
And in the end find you need a friend
To tell your troubles to.
Is it right to sit here every night
Think how it used to be.
Live some days you should remember
And you wish you could come back -
Come running home to me
Oh darling.
Run to me and I'll pretend
...
You run to me
Run to me.

"Yo man, hit me with one of those funky baselines One baseline at a time The sun takes a bow for a day well lit Next act is night with an audience of brothers and sisters Havin' a celebration of sorts Meetin' one another, hopin' soon to be lovers Sisters have always fascinated me The many shades, the many sizes and features Such a wide variety of African women Sometimes leaves me frustrated and speechless I try not to admire what I can't obtain or have Things beyond my reach, don't exist to speech Seein' how I'm a bit shorter than the average man I patiently wait for someone I can reach Many sisters don't understand my style I live my life in an outcast tribe A tribe that strives to see a brighter day I foresee that I'll walk with closed eyes, until dawn Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Rejection is a fear of mine, for one reason or another But I still asked for a date with this woman She said, ""No"", I said ,""Oh"" I forgot there's a gap between the richer and the poorer po' Slowly, all the shades, sizes and features Became less different and more the same Except a certain female with all new features But I knew not her name By this time the sun was preparin' For another appearance, the sky was pure red The night grabbed the moon and soon The darkness, yeah, was almost dead The sky now is orange and the night Has left the stage with curtains open wide And the bright sun yawns to signify a glorious bright new day The glorious day that I would meet, who? Dawn The natural dread also of the outcast tribe Knowledgeable enough to understand my style And as we kiss in the name of rejection The sky looks at us and warmly smiles Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads Yeah, the dread symbolizes the natural growth Of not just the hair, but also of the mind And also the bond that keeps us in love The struggle enhances that bond, throughout time When I see her, I see life The vast scope of life in her eyes of no wrong Faith plays a big ass part, I'm still kinda young But I could feel, I could really run with dawn Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the, dawn of the, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads It's a brand new song by Arrested Development Entitled 'Dawn Of The Dreads', I hope you enjoy it But all you can do now is put both feet up in the air And swing 'em back and forth to the music, thank you I say, dawn of the dreads I say, dawn of the dreads I say, dawn of the dreads Dawn of the dreads",Hip-Hop,Pop
"My ammunition won't load into my gun
My inhibitions, they fall like the weight from a stone
You lead my heart away like a homeless, dusted fool
Somehow this dime store ring still shines like a diamond to you

Oh, how it deepens
Oh, how it deepens

Your mystery
Keeps on turnin' me on
Your mystery

Thought I knew the rules, thought I held it in my hand
Thought I was bulletproof till the blood pooled up in the sand
Are you a satellite, a shooting star or a dove?
Did we put you way up there or did God send you down from above?

Oh, how it deepens
Oh, how it deepens

Your mystery
Keeps on turnin' me on
Your mystery
Burns me up like the sun
Your mystery

Mine eyes have seen the glory of a love that does transcend
Mine eyes have seen the worst inside of man
And fear is like a fallen bridge broken from an edge
And the proof is in the bloodshot eyes of the one who failed to see",R&B,Indie

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Folk,Jazz

We say we care, we need, we feel,
We read the movement of our eyes,
But in our hearts we still believe,
The end will come, before we know,
The silent rule of love applies,
We light the fuse and let it burn out,
We just accept that love must die,
And so they say, the end will come for us,
And so the world, slows down to let us off,
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must,
But I don't believe, I don't believe,
That the end will come for us,
No I won't believe, the end will come for us,
The end will come like sudden rain,
The end is never what it seems,
We sink the ship before it sails,
We just accept what failure means,
And so they say, the end will come for us,

We will burn your wretched churches where they stand, not until the christian flag is gone will I achieve my aim. Worship the ground I once walked. Obey those words I have said. This is the place haunted by ma shadow, Where even angels fear to tread. How can you deny my existence, even though you've seen my face. The battlescars of the ancient north, mark the damnation of the human race. Will I ever let the ravens fly again and let them do what has to be done? Will their black wings ever shadow the earth from the sun? From every side, from evrey open gate, they came to smear the blood into my face. Will I ever let the wolves haunt again and let them do what has to be done? Will their teeth and claws ever slaughter the priests and nuns? From every side, from every open gate, they came to smear the blood into my face. Will I ever unleash my daimons and let them do what has to be done? Will their powers and actions ever convince the world I am the one who won? Within the abyss I've felt my power grow, power of pure evil, power from below. With infernal strength I will lead the horde. Join me in the coming and follow the dark lore. The sky turned to red as we slew the angels in the clouds.

But I know you out there feeling so lonely

Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely
So as far as my eyes can see
You look better on me

Down in the keys keys keys
And I could bet the bank and almost guarantee
That you will always look better on me

In the boardroom and the bedroom
My name ain't max but I always got headroom
G-g- get it, g-g- g-g- get it
Went from selling perico and reefer
To New Year's Eve with Snoop and Latifah
I shut down Spain
And I ain't even have to take a pill in Ibiza
I'm a beast bro
I love when you put on them sexy one piece outfits
With the hole in the middle
Now take a look in the mirror
And see you always look better on me

So get from me with your negative ass
I live for the future, you live in the past
Found somebody else, I hope that it lasts
But you know that I know that we know
That you'll be thinking bout me
But you know that I know that we know
That you look, that you look better on me
I ain't here to sell ya, I'm here to tell ya
All I've ever done is learn from my failures
So god bless mami, cause God knows
I wish you the best mami, that's right

"If you could paint her, she'd be a Picasso. She's got a few things out of place. Like when she smiles, it's slightly out of line. It's half awkward, yet half grace. While you're unraveling this mystery Of where she fits in time and space, She'll drag you into this lover's tale, Though she will not give a reason. And if you fight her tooth and nail, She won't give up until you lose She wants the last word, the last dance. She thinks it's absurd that you believe in second chances. You're a lost cause, yet here she is. And that's the mystery. Here she is She's a poem by Ferlinghetti. She's the angel from a nursery rhyme She'll set you a place at your table, Then fill your cup till you're drunk on red wine. She don't believe in stars or in miracles, But she reads your horoscope daily. And if your response is too cynical, She'll say, ""Who are you to know?"" While you're unraveling this mystery Of where she fits in time and space, She'll memorize your history And decorate your place.",Pop,Jazz

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are

And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time when you fade to the blackness
And when you're starin at the phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and
I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank

And back when I was rappin for the hell of it

I'm guessing that if we could make some wishes out or
airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'd go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin we can make some wishes outa airplanes

"You mind tells you that you've lost your confidence
You're drifting and ya don't believe in anyone
To lose what little you have left to be proud of
Afraid you can't do this again, ah!
You said that nothing come in-between us
The way of getting things we wanted done
Then enissophobia held you under its influence
Until you compromised your style
Everything about you has been one big charade
What will you do now that the well's run dry? Cry?
To sell out all your friends and stab them in the back
It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not
When you forced me into doing what you love
Mark my words no one loves you very much, yeah mark em'
And when you tried to change me and tried to replace me
I couldn't help but end just hating you, hmm!
Being a fraud can only last so long, you should know
Till what ya sensed as a child returns, you little baby
To choke out the voice that told ya “money and the fame”
Would fill the crater that you dug for yourself
Unlike you I'm no vision to myself, lest you forget
You didn't ever make metal, buddy; metal made you
To crush and run over everyone along the way
It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not
A stranger to yourself, ha! ya pissed me off again
I won't be driven by your needs anymore
What you'd become to do or be is clear to see for me
It's something that you are; something that I'm not
It makes me sick to hear you say you “love me”
I know you only love what I can do for you
If you were the one that was leading the charge
Would you notice if I missed a day or two? But that's impossible!
We all laughed at the parodies that you'd become
Now your pain slowly paid back has begun
So, accept my resignation, or in your words “betrayal”
Before it gets much worse, end this self-sabotage
Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not
Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not
Something that you are, something I'm not, yet",Metal,Pop

To get back off to a while

See them point in your direction
See the indifference in their eyes

Struggling with too many wires

Other wise you won't get back

That's all he sees, he paints a tree
The trouble with a classicist he looks at the sky
He doesn't ask why, he just paints a sky
The trouble with an impressionist, he looks at a log
And he doesn't know who he is, standing, staring, at this log
And surrealist memories are too amorphous and proud
While those downtown macho painters
are just alcoholic
The trouble with impressionist is X4
The trouble with personalities, they're too wrapped up in style
It's too personal, they're in love with their own guile
They're like illegal aliens trying to make a buck
They're driving gypsy cabs but they're thinking like a truck

This hypodermic melancholy is not enough
Scratch test credit fraud- this hate is all I've got
Just feed me whiskey and you'll feel me- the time has come
Imagine all the people belittled and abused
You want a revolution?
I want the fucking truth
No voodoo ordeal can stop me now
I'll tear this place apart until you give me what I want
The last of the real can't stop me now
I'll tear this place apart until you give me what I want
Hundred dollar bills and quiet little kills
Think you can hold me?
It'll take an army
I'm everywhere
You press into the flesh; clichés are beat to death
Is this the best you can come up with?
Feels like despair
I made the news today- front page above the fold
You tell me god is dead- I'll show you hell is cold
No voodoo ordeal can stop me now
I'll tear this place apart until you give me what I want
The last of the real can't stop me now
I'll tear this place apart until you give me what I want
Until you give me what I want
Until you give me what I want
Bow your fucking head/ desecrate your dead can't you see
You're letting all the lies get in
Close your eyes for I have fucking sinned
Your talk is doubt/ remember how you wanted to be born again?
Well, you weren't born for this...
No voodoo ordeal can stop me now
I'll tear this place apart until you give me what I want
The last of the real can't stop me now
I'll tear this place apart until you give me what I want
Until you give me what I want

Your works and your understanding

And I'll always pay

The love is dead and hope has fled
Hate's the hurt my humanity
A corpse in bondage burns for thee

Raped by freedom while hate gave head

You've got a screaming silence
You're full of caution
Your regret is my abortion
This vicious victim lost his hold
Revenge is a dish that's best served cold
Let your bloodlust leave
Let your hate recede
I can take it all with one collect-call
Awake be forgiven arise with the living
Never see realize peel your eyes feel the prize

Innocence dies trust betrays
Hope remains I'm a fan of the flames
Hey there baby girl
I got a weakness for lies
And I'm speechless for highs

"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Jazz,Jazz
"When God made you
He had a lot to do
In a day or two
You were my dreams come true
Soul searching eyes
I visualize
A girl with heaven in her soul
If only you were mine
We'd have a mellow time
A pickin' flowers drinkin wine
Rivers of love flowing through
Valleys of dew
(flute break)
A time or so
I felt you should be free
To wait for your
Prince charming to arrive
Then come the time
I know I can't survive
Without your heart beating 'neath my breath
If only you were mine
We'd have a mellow time
Pickin' the flowers and drinkin' wine
Rivers of love flowing through
(flute break)
Bop wa bop du-wa
Bob wa Bop du-wa
Bop wa Bob du-wa
Bob wa Bop du-wa
Bop wa Bop du-wa
Bop wa Bop du-wa
Bop wa Bop du-wa
No other love
Could ever compensate
A heart of stone
My ever lasting fate
Alone at night
Tears cloud my dreams
But through the haze
Her image lasts
Oohhh if only you were mine
We'd have a mellow time
Pickin' flowers and drinkin' wine
Rivers of love flowing through
Valleys of dew
You're a diamond sparkling in the sand",Jazz,Country
"What you gonna do and what you gonna feel when suddenly I slip away? 
Almost am a ghost of who I use to be, yesterday 
How you going to touch and how will you collect the beauty when it turns to dust? 
Everything we make, the cells we generate are both of us

[Chorus] 
Please be aware that I am you
Nothing could be more certain 
This ain't the time, the place, for us to understand this life

Hold you in my arms, I'll hold you in my gaze, singing with my dying breath
Underneath this earth I'd resurrect your soul and nothing less
Sorry for the space, if I could fill the void an ocean wouldn't hold the love
And everything I have and all I ever was is not enough

[Chorus] 
Please be aware that I am you 
Nothing could be more certain 

This ain't the time, the place, for us to understand this life

I will forget me
I will forget me
I will forget me
I will protect you [x9]

Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Are you witch or heretic
Wandering lost convicts

Make you fear make you tear
Memories that scar for years
Drain your brain of guilt and regret
What's your last request

Endless pain
Living hell
No drawn out trial
No bars, no cell

Shut up don't be a fool
Electrocution make you drool
Burn your skin in search of truth
Sink or float either way you lose

Dead man walking straight to die
Eat last supper read last rites
Obsessed erotic with a mind possessed
Hug the blade one last caress

Cut the hand gouge the eye
Hung and whipped and burnt alive
A flood of blood, a sea of pain

What this could have been, but now you're frozen.

Another night with all my friends

Tried to be so strong

"The swans begin to bellow, Bellies full of pearls, Screaming down the houses, Whilst the willows start to fool. Bow their boughs and buckle, The curtains they are drawn, The cavalcade and symmetry, Commands for those to move. The mutiny procession, Somber and serene, A pageant on behalf to show, Her majesty's esteem. The lake is turning darker, It's as black as ostrich plumes, Though I paraded answers, With a noble magnitude. Nail down the mirrors, Pour the wars in the rooms, The hands of the grandfathers, Have settled on high noon. We are the ire We are the ire We are the ire Here the come the ire",Electronic,Folk

Bellying close to the ground
I was walking in the dark
It was following some feral scent
Like I was crossing the road
Like I was
Following those streets to their destinations

And the animals of the world
And the animals of the world
Find theirs

And when the wind stops
We all stop and we are silent
And in the end we all will bend
We will break away
From the ox head
We are moths around a porch light
We're covered in jars
Or pinned to the wall
Dried out and displayed
Tired out and dismayed
From riding on the winds
Biding the tides
Riding the winds
Or biding the tides

Flying with the sun
Or perched in a row
I was at a window sill
They were unaware like I was
A moment there and then gone
Like I was
Looking for a place to rest

And the animals of the world
And the animals of the world
Find theirs

And when the wind stops
We all stop and we are silent
And in the end
We all will bend
We will break away
From the ox head
We are moths around a porch light
We're covered in jars
Or pinned to the wall
Dried out and displayed
Tired out and dismayed
From riding on the wheels
Biding the streets
Riding the wheels

Silky smooth like wine

Almost hear you cry 
When you made sweet love to me 
And you turned on all the charm 
Acted much too calm 
You had a cold look in your eyes 

Did it mean nothing 
Was it all in vain 
Was I just your fool 
Or was the pleasure pain 

Have you set me free 
Or will I wake up 
In the morning 
And find out it's been a bad dream 

Come on, I beg you 
I want to be your main man

Almost hear you cry

Dull smash of shatterproof glass,
Everything stopped in the parking lot,
For a little girl face down on the ground,
We all knew that she gone,
All came near, no nothing was said,
I had never seen somebody dead,

For me everything changed

Understand I was very high,
I just quit my job, no I just got fired
The day she died for me everything changed
Could've been the shame of not even trying,
Could've been the blood in her matted hair,
Or how regrets of the dying are added to the air

"me and my friends 
we don't encourage discipline 
or really much of anything. 
we do our drugs 'till we're lit up. 
tell ourselves that this is love. 
but it's never added up 
and it will never be enough. 

it's the same corner booth, 
the same smith street bar, 
the same sour mouths, 
and the same empty arms. 
forever and ever our lives 
on a route. 

it's the same dollar draft, 
the same whiskey words, 
the same hanging heart, 
and the same old scorched earth. 
we're further and further 
away from the truth. 

i wanna stop it. 
i wanna stop it. 
i wanna stop it. 
but it's the only life i know how to live 

we make a mess of what matters 
give our good grace away 
we try to drink the clock backwards 
and pretend like nothing?s changed 

but you think i?m a liar, but you think i?m a fake 
and i think you?re a coward, but it?s not what i say 
i call you my brother, and you call me the same 

i wanna stop it. 
i wanna stop it. 
i wanna stop it. 
but it's the only life i know how to live 

let the steel (?) words spew out of the sides of my mouth 
go be my ghost and i?ll got be yours

yeah tonight brother pour me one 
yeah tonight i?ll just cut you one more 
yeah tonight i?ll just cut you one more

"A time so haunting, moonlight in the mist
Lay me down beside you, oh, as long as it lasts
From the river comes a figure, drifting slowly by
Trailing long the water, leaving softer than a sigh,
Softer than a sigh
All the feelings, they remain like a still life
A dying swan song, forever lost your cries of glory
The rain is falling down like silence in a shroud
When all that really matters left to loose
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
All the feelings, they remain like a still life
A dying swan song, forever lost your cries of glory
Walking from the shadows a fear of sadness grows
Your heart is in your hands, your knowing looks
Our time is gone
My time is gone
Swan's dying song",Folk,Indie

Blackbird was in the field and the sun was getting dim The breeze running through the trees like an organ in a hymn Thoughts were suspended like a leaf out on a limb Fire was burning low and the winter coming in Now some music was playing in the background of the night Some friends from around came in and they all said things were high And we spoke of a stranger that we all met on the way Who said there was danger in those who watch out for their greed Now the summer is past the grain and the river getting high It's amazing a month can bring so many things that can get by The old ways were drowning to the new ones with a sigh It seems so incredible that sometimes I could cry.,Country,Folk
"Ladies and Gentlemen
I wanna introduce to you right now
Young Donovan... He's eleven (mmmmm)
The problem we're facing right now
Is we're losing our children (ooooooo)
Father's we need you (mmmmmm)
Can you feel me?

[Chorus:]
It takes a whole nation
To help me raise this generation
When you look out of your window
Tell me what do you see
If it's a world without a father
Then you're looking at me
It takes a whole nation
To help me raise this generation
My respect to the mother's that be holdin' it down
But it sure would be nice to have my daddy around

[Verse 1:]
All I need is one mic (one mic)
I know you can see
I'm not a rapper
But there's some dudes that are just like me
Every time you took a picture with you and your family
It was only two people and it's supposed to be 3
It's supposed to be me asking
(Why's the sky blue when I grow up I wanna be like you)
Yo daddy can you teach me how to
(Tie my shoes can I go with you to work so I can see what you do?)
Lemme see what you do
So I can love my kids too
But you didn't stick around was that too much to ask of you?
Too much to get a blueprint(No)
Too much to show your way (No)
That's the reason why this building is not finished still today(We're lost boys)
So you wanna believe that (My daddy's coming back he didn't forget about me)
Only child after school
We just sit there and wait (I know he's gonna come)
Your dad is 78

[Chorus:]
It takes a whole nation (It takes a whole nation)
To help me raise this generation
When you look out of your window (Look out this evening)
Tell me what do you see
If it's a world without a father
Then you're looking at me (Come on)
It takes a whole nation (Nation)
To help me raise this generation (uh uh)
My respect to the mother's that be holdin' it down
But it'd sure be nice to have my daddy around (Daddy around)

[Verse 2:]
Check this out
They say raising kids is the parents responsibility (mmmmm)
But there's a million of Y'all and only one of me(hey)
What happened to the village as far as I can see
It's been burned down by this modern day slavery

[Donovan:]
For 11 years I've been living here
I've seen mamma cry more than 11 tears
Watchin' mamma see daddy while he slips away
Does Jesus really hear kids when they pray?

[Kirk:]
She's working to jobs
She can't do it alone
She shouldn't have to she didn't get knocked up on her own
Both: And I know that baby's mamma drama
Brothas it's real
But before you close the door
Don't forget how it feels
Remember

[Donovan:]
Daddy missed my game and I made a touchdown
I won the talent show but you weren't around
If a girl breaks my heart what do I do with this pain (and one more thing daddy)
Can you tell me my name?

[Chorus:]
It takes a whole nation
To help me raise this generation (I need my daddy)
When you look out of your window
Tell me what do you see
If it's a world without a father
Then you're looking at me (Yay)
It takes a whole nation (It's a million of us)
To help me raise this generation (Oh... uh... Oh Lord)

But it'd sure be nice to have my daddy around.(Everybody that didn't have a father in your life... I want you to stand up and sing this part right here)(Hey)

Ain't nothing gonna break me down (Hey)
Can't let nobody take me down (Nobody taught me)
Can't let nobody break me down... Me down (Break me down)
(I had to figure this thing out by myself)

(Heaven can you hear me?)

Ain't nothing gonna break me down
Can't let nobody take me down (can't you here we're lonely?)(Come on)
Can't let nobody break me down... Me down (I'll be their father... I'll be their man! Come on)

(If you feel me say yeah!)
It takes a whole nation
(Ain't nothing gonna break me down)
To help me raise this generation(If you feel me say yeah
(Can't let nobody take me down)
(I hear you people)

"There's a story told of a little Japanese
Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
'Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came

They met 'neath the cherry blossoms everyday
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with her soul t'was easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor butterfly
'Neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly
For she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low

The moon and I know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back, then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

"[Chorus:]
Now when you climb
Into your bed tonight
And when you lock
And bolt the door
Just think of those
Out in the cold and dark
'Cause there's not enough love to go round

Now when you climb [fade]
And when you lock [fade]
Just think of those
out in the cold and dark
'Cause there is not enough love to go round

I tell you, wake up
You people need a shake up
You take up so much time
Worrying, scurrying
Here, there
Losing your hair
No money to spare
No love to share
No wonder you appear under pressure from here
You look fresher
But all I got is dirt in my hair
My nightmares manifest
But I can escape
Your's is in your chest
With no form or shape
The tape is running
I push the button to send
Upon each other we all depend
Message end

Whoever asks my name
Or where I came from
People fear contamination
If they chary too long
I carry a strong
Scent of despair
It's in the air
I'm broken and hard to repair
I may mistaken be
But I patiently wait
On the path to humanity
I sit at the gates

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Dirty, cold, hurting, sold
Down the river
My liver in bad condition
Like my skin
Rain falling, once again
I'm in my bed
Hurt the time in
I'm gonna struggle for air
There's hair in my food
When I get it usually someone already half ate it
I try not to let it
Get me down
But my head's starting to pound
People go round, and round and round

From one I get a cigarette
A little more love found
But the ground is still wet
My teeth are chattering
And there's a spattering of seeds
Sometimes I lose all feeling in my feet
When I sleep I'll do my deep in the mainstream
But unaccountably my heart has grown
Small and mean
I hurry past
Retched people I pretend I haven't seen
But there's money in my pocket
And my clothes are clean

(Repeat 4X)
I said money in my pocket
But I just can't give no love
Money in my pocket
But I just can't give no love

Lonely love, lonely love
Might be forever
For all the better lonely loves

We could keep going
And let this get out of hand
It'd be nothing new
For me or for your boyfriend's band

Stone cold sober
But you still get me high

Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",Jazz,Jazz

Don't get out, the morning wants to keep us safe in here
Resting on your shoulder
We wont go, until there's no,
More people out there

With the clean cut

Are coming ashore
Flushing over me

Your are all over my rainbow
Taking the scene
In my crazy dream
Only you are on my rainbow
No one else here
Nothing else gets near
You

Nothing's fast or slow
Its in between
Were red and green
Where land and oceans meet
Peacefully I'm quiet
Cause nothing here is
Mad, bad or dangerous to know

Show me what he's done to you
Stand up, little girl
A broken heart can't be that bad
When it's through, it's through
Fate will twist the both of you
So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too

Just to be the next to be with you

Build up your confidence
So you can be on top for once
Wake up.  Who cares about little boys
That talk too much?
I've seen it all go down
The game of love was all rained out
Let me be the one to hold you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

Why be alone when we can be together, baby?
You can make my life worth while
I can make you start to smile
When it's through, it's through
And fate will twist the both of you

"Love's the funeral of hearts
And anode for cruelty
When angels cry blood
On flowers of evil in bloom
The funeral of hearts
And a plea for mercy
When love is a gun
Separating me from you
She was the sun
Shining upon
The tomb of your hopes and dreams so frail
He was the moon
Painting you
With it's glow so vulnerable and pale
Love's the funeral of hearts
And ode for cruelty
When angels cry blood
On flowers of evil in bloom
The funeral of hearts
And a plea for mercy
When love is a gun
Separating me from you
She was the wind, carrying in
All the troubles and fears you've for years tried to forget
He was the fire, restless and wild
And you were like a moth to that flame
The heretic seal beyond divine
A prayer to a god who's deaf and blind
The last rites for souls on fire
Three little words and a question why
Love's the funeral of hearts
And ode for cruelty
When angels cry blood
On flowers of evil in bloom
The funeral of hearts
And a plea for mercy
When love is a gun
Separating me from you",Indie,Folk

Honey, I wanna drink from that lovin' cup, too

You don't wash your hair, you don't wash your clothes
What else you don't do baby nobody knows

Won't you tell me somebody what can I do
Honey, I wanna drink from that lovin' cup, too

Instead of walkin' these streets baby actin' funny

Won't you tell me somebody what can I do

"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",Jazz,Jazz

"I am a little beggarman and begging I have been
For three score or more in this little isle of green
I'm known from the Liffey down to Segue
And I'm known by the name of old Johnny Dhu
Of all the trade's that's going, sure begging is the best
For when a man is tired, he can sit down and rest
He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
Only cut around the corner with his old rig-a-doo

I slept in the barn, down at Caurabawn
A wet night came on and I slept 'till the dawn
With holes in the roof and the rain coming through
And the rats and the cats, they were playing peek-a-boo
When who did I waken but the woman of the house
With her white spotty apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said ""boo
Aarah, don't be afraid mam it's only Johnny Dhu""

I met a little flaxy-haired girl one day
""Good morning little flaxy-haired girl"" I did say
""Good morning little beggarman, a how do you do
With your rags and you tags and you old rig-a-doo""
I'll buy a pair of leggings, a collar and a tie
And a nice young lady I'll fetch by and by
I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll colour them blue
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too

Over the road with my pack on my back
Over the fields with my great heavy sack
With holes in my shoes and my toes peeping through
Singing skinny-me-rink a doodle o and old Johnny Dhu
I must be going to bed for it's getting late at night
The fire's all raked and out goes the light
So now you've heard the story of my old rig-a-doo
It's good-bye and God be with you says old Johnny Dhu",Folk,Folk

Registered at Smith's hotel as Mr Hayseed Brown
A jay he was so y'all admit with whiskers green as grass,
Pulled off his shoes jumped into bed and then blew out the gas
And he never came back, he never came back,
And as they broke down the door,
Oh the last words he said, just before he dropped dead,
Were ""we'll meet on that beautiful shore""

She laughed at everything she saw 'til she nearly broke her jaw
Nearby I saw a big balloon which proved to be my friend
I threw her in, I cut the rope, and up she did ascend
And she never came back, she never came back,
Though we waited for six days or more
Oh, there's one thing I know, I will go down below,

Darkended notes with bright decor

Pushing down the cafe drinks
Checking the arrival screens for your

There's a girl riding down

Her sleeves are all stretching out

On a giant ferris wheel.
Up in the neon sky
Or far from the barker's cry
One kiss can sometimes
Make you feel like a
Spinning Ferris wheel.
All the tents are taken down now;
All that's left is scuffled ground now;
Still the magic echoes in the sand.

"I'm not much into dogs
And they're not into me
That's my history
I can't change it now
Cause those dogs are still on the prowl

[Chorus]
Dogs are puppies that grow up wild
And they don't do what you want them to
Treat you nice just to get a prize
And once they get it 
Then they're through with you

Get your digits to call you back
You'll never hear from him again, that's whack
He tells you you're the only one that's phat
Then hits your friend up behind your back

[Chorus]

He asked you out to see a show
And lost his wallet, how? He doesn't know
He asked you if you'd pay the bill
He'll pay you back, oh yeah, I bet he will

I bet he will
I bet he won't
He'll probably use it for a bag of smoke
A bag of smoke
You know the kind
That makes you tipsy like a bottle of wine

They like to bite
They like to fight
They like to howl at every girl in sight
They like to beg
They like to whine
They like to smell at every stray behind

A stray behind
You know the kind
They're big and round and they're easy to find
Easy to find
They are for dogs
As for a dog's life, it's a world of fun

I ain't no dog, you know I ain't no dog
How you goin' come at me like that
You know me better than that
Don't try to come and say men are dogs
Without saying that you all dogs too
The reflection of a man is the woman, it's true
And I'm here to let you know about a boo
Who tried to give her everything
Which really doesn't seem quite enough
That's why some of us give up so easy
Relationships gettin' too tough
All of a sudden there goes your friend
Flossin' around like she's sexy
What you don't know is that she'll let me
If she get a chance to get in my pants
Once or twice for her it's nice
She be schemin' from the start
Waiting for us to fall apart
I leave a little stuff inside my car

[Chorus]

Now a dog's a dog, that's just gon' be
In a group, in a single, or in different breeds
Past my fast life, perpetrating the front
Schemin' on opposite sex for what you want
Whoo, whoo, when you hear 'em callin'
Back up wit' the dog who ballin'
Take advice from the wise
When you see him comin'
It's when you slip up, we'll all be hummin'
Cause the grave's cold and the ground's wet
Tryin' to trick love on the cost of bets
See they're skank in every state
And only you can seal your fate
You twist and turn in the burnin' wreck
I leave a memory that he'll never forget
That's why there was a need to talk about dogs
To give an example to all why y'all",Pop,R&B

Though the morning light will burn away All the fog the night creates, There'll still be a trace of our love left behind In the dew upon the vine Where to go or to hide, You're only worth your old lies Confiding in your own mine, Caught in the cold lie, I thought you were better man I thought you were better man A slip step on the tight rope, Freaked out by a false hope That things could be alright No they're not alright I don't pay any mind To the dew upon the vine Does that mean that it's not there, If I can see it at all? Though the morning light will burn away All the fog the night creates, There'll still be a trace of our love left behind In the dew upon the vine I'll contain my heart, It's like lightning trying to put out a spark I'll contain my heart, You're like lightning trying to put out a spark I never payed any mind To the dew upon the vine Does that mean that it's not there, If I can see it at all?

Nobody loves a drink anymore than me I might buy a round or two or three And I've been known to stumble and hit the floor Oh but I'm never too drunk to make it to the door Red wine can start my head a swimmin' but I draw the line when it comes to women I never met a woman that could make me roam and I do my swinging at home She gives me more love better love sweeter love true love and that's where I belong I might do a lotta talking but soon you'll see me walking Cause I do my swinging at home She gives me more love better love sweeter love true love and that's where I belong I might do a lotta talking but soon you'll see me walking I do a lotta swinging a lotta love song singing but I do my swinging at home,Country,Country
"Today was the worst day,
I went through Hell,
I wish I could remove it from my mind,
Two months away from you,

Smelled like cheap perfume,
And it didn't smell like you,
There is no way you can get around it

That you weren't the right one for me

"A black swan
Is born that night
The misty pond
(Has) got a new king
Got a new king
So what can we do
With our lives
When it all begins
It's hard and
It's cruel
Will grace die in pain?
Will light ever rise again?

I'm trapped in darkness
Still I reach out for the stars
I'm moving in silence
I leave it all far behind

Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns

Let us march on
To the fields of sacrifice
(I'm) wondering why
I'll carry on
Will I betray myself
To rise

In the silence
It's time to explain
(And)
Search for truth in lies
Useful lies
Needless love's damned

What can we do with our lives
When it all begins

Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns

Come follow me
And you will see
How it will be
When all the pain is gone away

Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns

Let us march on
Though there's no hope at our side
Let us be brave
Though by glory we are denied
But
Don't you think
It's time for us
To bring to an end
Come play the song of death
The wisdom in us both
Will make it
Special guaranteed
Play the song of death

I can't flee

It's deep within

"""I was born amidst the purple waterfalls.
I was weak, yet not unblessed.
Dead to the world
Alive for the journey.
One night I dreamt a white rose withering,
a newborn drowning, a lifetime loneliness.
I dreamt all my future, relived my past
And witnessed the beauty of the beast""
Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?
Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?
Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time
I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of Man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path
Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time
""Where have all the feelings gone?
Why is the deadliest sin - to love as I loved you?
Now unblessed, homesick in time,
soon to be freed from care, from human pain.
My tale is the most bitter truth:
Time pays us but with earth & dust, and a dark - silent grave.
Remember, my child: Without innocence the cross is only iron,
hope is only an illusion & Ocean Soul's nothing but a name...
The Child bless thee & keep thee forever""",Metal,Metal

But the lamb ran away with the crown
So I drew my sword and got ready
but the lamb ran away with the crown
Tho' the beast within me's a liar
He made me glow with a strange desire
And I rode on the fire, with a blue sacred opal
to bless the battleground
But I turned to see its reflection
and the lamb ran away with the crown
Once a demon lived in my brow
I screamed and wailed and I cursed out loud
And I sailed through the clouds on ten crested cardinals
To guard my battleground
But I laughed so hard I cried
And the lamb ran away with the crown

"She came down the stairs in her cocktail dress
She fell on her food like a lioness
There was ringing in my ears like an SOS
She said ""You dream too much.
If you think I've a thing for you.
You dream too much. 
It's going to end bad""

The boom box was sounding sweet
We were dancing to a jungle beat
Just when our lips were about to meet
She said ""You dream too much.
Ah who's that girl in your dreams with you?
You dream too much. 
It's going to end bad""

You'll stumble going through life 
The way that you do
I hope I'm somewhere else 
The day that you do
The way that you do

She had a chassis like an XJS
A skull necklace like a high priestess
I thought maybe just one caress
She said ""You dream too much.
You're dreaming now 
While I'm talking to you.
You dream too much. 
It's going to end bad. 
Oh it's going to end bad""

I start thinking of the perfect kiss
Velvet dream on an iron fist

She came with her blue jeans on
Wanting to star in a song.
Get you with your ins and outs of it,
You're coming on strong, so strong
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna make love to you.
She lifted my spirits high,
I noticed the dream in her eye.
Softly I entered her garden
Parting her veil with a sigh.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do,
I'm going to give my love to you.
I tidied up my last affair,
I lost so much I don't care
Felt like a fool in a foolery,
But I'm well on my way to repair.
I know you ain't no hanger on,
Baby, you can star in a song.
I took a look inside her head,
I saw a Victorian bed.
I took her to the fair green country,
I'm so weary of the life I've led
I'll tell you what we're gonna do,
We're gonna live and love so true.

Come play kill.
Refuse my body, refuse my shadow
Stone cold will
Refuse to lead this, refuse to follow
Bitter pills
Refuse to feed this, refuse to swallow, I'm fueled godless

Come play, come play

"(Gordon Kennedy/Wayne Kirkpatrick) They married on a fancy yacht out on the water He knew she was young enough to be his daughter There always questions in the heart of millionaires Would she make heartfelt promises if the money was not there And he said, do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold Or are you just digging for gold Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul Or are you just digging for gold She ran his weary heart through the ringer And she wore him like the diamond ring around her finger Well, his advances and affections, she managed to avoid But, she got the lap of luxury and he got paranoid And he said, do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold Or are you just digging for gold Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul Or are you just digging for gold, digging for gold Big house, limousines, Fine wines, fine cuisines, Vale and Vegas twice a year, Trips to Paris on the leer Black Tuesday when that wall of wealth came crashing down Bad news day when that little queen had to give back her crown And he said, hey babe, we can live on love 'cause love is worth much more But he barely got his feelings out, she was half way to the door And she never even heard him cry Do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold Or are you just digging for gold Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul Or are you just digging for gold",Country,Country

Another lie moves over

Through my restless, shaking heart

Drew back your bow

Straight through my heart

Along the salt sea strand
The colours blend and roll as one
Together in the sand.
And often do the winds entwine
Do send their distant call,
The quiet joys of brotherhood,
And love is lord of all.

The oak and weed together rise,
Along the common ground.
The mare and stallion light and dark
Have thunder in their sound.
The rainbow sign, the blended flower
Still have my heart in thrall.
The quiet joys of brotherhood,
And love is lord of all.

But man has come to plough the tide,
The oak lies on the ground.
I hear their tires in the fields,
They drive the stallion down.
The roses bleed both light and dark,
The winds do seldom call.

When love was lord of all.",Folk,Folk

I dreamed that you were older
You were looking like Picasso
With a scar across your shoulder

You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children

Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago

Were you there at Armageddon
Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning

And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing

And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth
So far below

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you laid dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk above you crying

For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you
Long ago

Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender

And could you hear me calling out your name
Well, I guess that I will never know

I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping

And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago

i don't need to waste time runnin' around all over town
now i know where to find true lovin'
and i knew the first time that i ever seen you
let's stay together girl it would be so nice
if we just hold on and stay together
everything will be alright. tell me why it feels so strong
the years roll by
but s'til this heart you own
i never felt a love so completely
don't you know we're riding on destiny
and i knew the first time that i ever seen you
ooh girl you got me
'cause when i wake up
you're the first thing on my mind
tomorrow will be
so let's leave the past behind
just let me lead you
to our happy ever after

why don't we stay awhile,",R&B,R&B
"November came and went, 
Like a summer that I spent, 
With a no name girl that walked in jelly shoes. 
I returned to my home, 
With a heart part made of stone, 
And I cried all night for a girl I never knew. 
From the east it comes, 
Her love and the rising sun, 
And I pray each time they come, it's not the last. 
You see I've got strong, 
I made it through what came along, 
But I can't move on for the beauty of the past. 

Came across a pretty girl, 
For about a month she was my world, 
And I held her hand, and swore we'd never part. 
I moved on, she stayed behind, 
I said I'd call, she said she'd write, 
We lost touch the moment I drove off. 
I left town like a gambler with, 
The sense of cashin' all the chips, 
Before I lost them all on a bad deal. 
I made believe I was in a race, 
Drove ten thousand miles in seven days, 
While writing a book called ""Being A Free Man"". 
Met more people than the president, 
The good times came and the good times went, 
And I learned how to ignore my hunger pangs. 
I looked ahead to the open road, thought about the people and what they know, 
And wrote a book called ""People Don't Know Nothin"". 
(no matter what they tell ya, man) 

Once I spent my last dime, 
And counted the ratio of miles to time, 
I looked up to my disdain and my surprise. 
I had driven my car around the world, 
Ended back in the town with the girl, 
So I wrote a book called ""Life in Prison"". 
(Volume. 1) 
I see that girl every now and then, 
And we drink to having such good friends, 
And apologize for the way it did not last. 
Funny thing that it's all true, 
And I'll always love November Blue, 
But I turned her down for the beauty of the past. 

November came and went, 
Like a summer that I spent, 
With a no name girl that walked in jelly shoes. 
I returned to my home, 
With a heart part made of stone, 
And I cried all night for a girl I never knew.",Indie,Country

"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Jazz,Jazz

"A North country maid up to London has strayed
Although with her nature it did not agree.
So she wept and she sighed and bitterly she cried,
""Oh, I wish once again in the North I could be.""
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree
They all grow green in the North country.
While sadly I roam I regret my dear home,
Where the lads and young lasses are making the hay.
Where the birds sweetly sing, and the merry bells do ring
And the maidens and meadows are pleasant and gay.
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree
They all grow green in the North country.
No doubt if I please, I could marry with ease,
Where maidens are fair, many lovers will come.
But he that I wed must be North country bred
And carry me back to my own country.
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree.",Folk,Jazz

Hour of our trials, ours too sickening to live

You didn't do it completely but you were discreet
Like the year I spent comparing me to you, please return it

Please return it
Bring the balance back to you

"As I was a-walking down Radcliffe highway
A recruiting party came a-beating my way
They enlisted me and treated me till I did not know
And to the Queen's barracks they forced me to go
When first I deserted, I thought myself free
Until my cruel comrade informed against me
I was quickly followed after and brought back with speed
I was handcuffed and guarded, heavy irons put on me
Court martial, court martial, they help upon me
And the sentence passed upon me, three hundred and three
May the Lord have mercy on them for their sad cruelty
For now the Queen's duty lies heavy on me
When next I deserted, I thought myself free
Until my cruel sweetheart informed against me
I was quickly followed after and brought back with speed
I was handcuffed and guarded, heavy irons put on me
Court martial, court martial, then quickly was got
And the sentence passed upon me, that I was to be shot
May the Lord have mercy on them for their sad cruelty
For now the Queen's duty lies heavy on me

Saying ""Where is that young man whose coffin is fixed?
Set him free from his irons and let him go free

Saying I should talk to you.

Tell you what's goin' on inside;
I don't even know when's the last time that I

And there is no way, no one compares to you.
No way, no one compares to you to me.

my source of life and peace.
Your love, it falls like raindrops,
and never seems to cease.

you're the lover of my soul.

no way I could ever let you go, so I

I'm not leavin' til your spirit falls on me.

Who could I have in heaven, Lord, but you?
There's no one, there's no one.
Tell me, who could be who you are and do what you do?
Your beauty Lord, I long to see, see.
In your presence I find joy and peace,
so to be close to you, yeah.

Better is one day in your courts.
Better is one day in your house.
Than a thousand somewhere elses
I could never do without.
Your grace and your mercies,
the air that I breathe;
your promises are residing abundantly.",R&B,R&B

"On the black Sunday afternoon sun is pale like the moon
When you look to the sky, holy, holy why
All fades into blue on the black Sunday afternoon

No good time to walk alone on a bike riding home
When you look to the sky, holy, holy why
All fades into blue on the black Sunday afternoon

Bad luck comes or just a car on the right side, hears a call
And sees a blackbird flying low, above her head no mistletoe
Nothing really moves on black Sunday afternoons

You wake up in a water bed and on the back of your head
A lump but just a tiny hole, almost no light at all in here
When you call you can't hear your own voice at all

They gather up, something's wrong
They ask around, no one knows
Well, have you been where the rivers cross by the water in the moss?
Nothing really moves on black Sunday afternoons

Sun is pale like the moon
When you look to the sky, holy, holy, holy, holy why
All fades into blue on black Sunday afternoons",Pop,Folk
Love will find a way Though I should know better That nothing lasts forever Our love will find a way All my love for you will never die You broke my heart on a rainy Sunday morning When you walked out of the door You didn't even turn around to say Good-bye And I don't know why Still I can't get you out of my mind But nothing will last forever Every night I'm crying for you Will I cry forever? Love will find a way... We walked hand in hand for an endless summer We were always together I was sure that you would be mine forever Now I don't know why Still I can't get you out of my mind...,Pop,Country
"Birds beneath my window dusting their wings upon the lawn
I hear them in the morning light giving last amen to a migratory song
They're never looking round for me their eyes are on the sky or the ground below
But I'd rather be the one who loves than to be loved and never even know

[Chorus]
Hello blackbird hello starling
Winter's over be my darling
It's been a long time coming
But now the snow is gone

You were beautiful when I first saw your feathers and confectionery airs
Like the earth it up and promised you the stars but you really didn't care
I sang in exultation pulled the stops you always looked a little bored
But I'm singing for the love of it have mercy on the man who sings to be adored

[Chorus]

I'm underneath your window now it's long after the birds have gone to roost
And I'm not sure if I'm singing for the love of it or for the love of you
But I've flown a long way honey hear my confession then I'll go
I'd rather be the one who loves than to be loved and never even know
Hello brown one hello blue one
Last night's feathers exchanged for new ones

[Chorus]",Folk,Country
"Another kiss goodbye, another sorrowed eye, 
Another victim of the game, do what you can to make it seem alright. 
Kiss my ass, don't look back, you are lost, you are last, you are living a lie. 
Do our eyes deceive our minds in the search for light? 
Fuck you. 

Keep your self righteous life and watch me grow. 
Within the sequence of your mind the programme stops the progress 
This is another reason to follow my heart. 

You forced me to follow generic blueprints 
But I still live inside my dreams. 
As you hold me down, this is time to fight your grip. 
Without your misdirection my life wont end in heartache
Fight for my generations birthright to be amazed. 
You've told me my passion is just a waste of time. 

(I) won't live my life by your rules. 
Gouge out my eyes (and) as the blood drips from the sockets finally it's clear
Vision comes from the mind inside, 
The soul and the heart that binds the spirit and will for life. 

Signs surface everyday, the soul and the heart will show us (that) sadness can be defied. 
Reason calling out my name, (I'm) trying to escape from it. 
Reason denies the faith in me. 
Prepare to fall my hands are cleansed your on your own, 
You've had your time you can't deny it. 

You fall from grace, if time could speak would you believe? 
Or would you still be fucking blind? 
Your doubts won't cast shadows across my memories. 
You cannot take my memories.",Metal,Indie

No sign of meat on, no sign of gristle

Noble dukes and princes stripped of flesh and finery
When the crows have done their job, they say that's the time for me

And I even dream of bones when I'm lying very ill
Roomsfull of skeletons a-dancing the quadrille
Rows and rows of skulls singing Blueberry Hill
Sam Jones deliver them bones
And if you're unburied, the likes of me will find you
You're no good to worms, but you might become the finest glue
We'll grind you up and spread you out as fertiliser, too

My services don’t come cheap
But I help out when I can
Tell them lies that they wanna hear
AndI really lead em on
Spend all of their money
And I’m long, gone
I’m a bad, bad, boy
And I’m gonna steal your love
I’m a bad, bad, boy
And I’m gonna steal your love
Come take me to your house
Then I’m gonna rip you off
I’ve got tastes for fast cars
I don’t wanna settle down
The good life sure come s easily
With all the mugs around
The women they just come to me
I don’t have to look around
I move into their homes with them
Then I move on
I’m a bad, bad, boy
And I’m gonna steal your love
I’m a bad, bad, boy
I’m gonna steal your love
Come take me to your house

That's just the way life goes
One more empty home
Can't eat, won't sleep, missing a part of me

Say the words we never said
Every day I'm such a mess
What I'd give for

Just another moment by your side

It's hard livin' without you in my life
(All I ever do is)
Man, I gotta laugh before I cry

'Cause all I ever do, all I ever do
All I ever do is say goodbye
Is say goodbye, is say goodbye

The future in your eyes lives in a perfect memory
Hanging on for life
Though you've gone too soon
And left me feeling heavy
I celebrate our time

Praying one day that we'll meet again
Say the words we never said
Every day I'm such a mess
What I'd give for

And I'm gonna miss them

I hope that you were listenin'

"[Spoken]
When I think back on this life
I guess we were doing the best we could
And to look at us from the outside
I'm sure it seems somewhat romantic
but when you've tasted excess
Everything else tastes bland
Yeah, we had everything to lose
But we still lived like we were about to die
After all, we were the drug scouts of america
I've begun evaporating
Right before your eyes
I just keep regurgitating
My own demise
I miss today I miss the past
I miss my veins 'cause they've collapsed
A simple thought occurs to me
I'm face down on the tracks
The train is coming fast
And it's not derailing
It's not the first time
And this won't be the last
That my heart is failing
As the blood is rushing
to my head
And from my wrists
I'm in love with all the things I know I should resist
And all the times you said to me
Your falling down ones destiny
A simple thought occurs to me
I'm face down on the tracks
The train is coming fast
And you're right there waiting
It's not the first time
And this won't be the last
That my heart is failing
[Spoken]
Like I was saying
The look in the eyes of death
Was intoxicating
Taking it into our lungs
Laughing at ourselves
Where others would probably cry
And more importantly
I'm proud of this guy
Staring face to face with the demons
And not back down
Takes a constitution that most people just don't have
A life gets soiled with sex, drugs and rock and roll
I'm face down on the tracks
The train is coming fast
And it's not derailing
It's not the first time
And this won't be the last
That my heart is failing
I'm face down on the tracks
The train is coming fast
And you're right there waiting
It's not the first time
And this won't be the last
That my heart is failing",Metal,Electronic

Lets get up, up, up, up
And I jus wanna dance and play a little bit
And baby I'm the man and shawty you the shit

While I got my energy up all in the club
With the lights down low
And I got you
Tipsy and youre all up on me pullin all my clothes

Girl get your purse let me grab my coat
Got my keys so now we can roll back to the crib

All I think about when she not around

Run around butt naked this my house
All these thoughts on my mind I gotta get them out

'Cause we didn't have much money
But I knew I would make it someday
They told me I was nothing
That I'd never be something
But I knew I would make it someday

This is my story, I was a girl who
Came from nothing & life in my surroundings
Was bad. but deep inside me
I would pray for god to guide me
'Cause I knew he'd give me strength for life
And all it's problems back then.

Hand me down clothing 
Empty shelves inside the cupboard
And mama kept three jobs to make do
I'd hear her cryin'
But she never stopped between
Three girls, light bill and the rent ya'll
Livin' wasn't easy back then

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
By faith I believed one day I'd
Sing and things would get better
So don't give up no matter what it seems

I wanna see Jesus face to face
I believe it, I believe in
One fine day
He's gonna come shining through the clouds
Gonna come shout my name out loud
I believe it, I believe that
One fine day
He's coming back for me


I'm talking happy ever after
I'm talking twice upon a time
I know the only thing that matters
His heart is coming back for mine
I have found the peace and joy just imagining
I find my hope in Him

"Once I was young, yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps
Once I was young, but never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was
Then you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Once I was old, twenty years or so
Rather well preserved, the wrinkles didn't show
Once I was old, but not too old for fun
I used to hunt for little girls up my imaginary gun
But now I ain't for only one

Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands

The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Jazz,Jazz

And this little piece of Heaven

What if I never make it home, home?

That I can't bring myself to face

So let it go
Don't bring it up
Put more value on
What you want to give up

What if I fall?
Nothing could make me change my mind
My travel scar
And they break more broken hearts

I'd have run away
My dependence made me stay
Now I'm tired and afraid

And the world at large
A frightening place

"Far on the other side
There's a story just as long as mine
I keep telling everybody
Is it something I should hide
Cry right before my eyes
Keep my secrets and unveil my lies
You should be a little careful
I've been careful all my life
Left behind so many times
I fall again
You can stay a little while
But stay, just stay

"Well they met in line at the checkout stand
Both unaware of what the gods had planned
She was lost in her Cosmo readin' about the stars
He was readin' about two-headed babies from Mars
When she reached for a Snickers she dropped her keys
And so began one of life's mysteries
He was a little old-fashioned and a little oversexed
He picked them up never guessing what would happen next
Then she smiled and said I like your tie
Yeah she smiled and told him that little white lie
And his soul lit up like the fourth of July
When she smiled
They made it to Starbuck's just before it closed
He pointed to the jar and said you want one of those
So over biscotti and double decafs
They shared their stories and they had some laughs
He got up his courage and asked her back to his place
Then he held his breath as he studied her face
She just sat and she stared and she said nothing at all
He knew he blew it and he waited for the ax to fall
Then she smiled and he knew he hadn't been wrong
Yeah she smiled and said what took you so long
And the world felt good like a rock and roll song
When she smiled
When she smiles I forget my lines
When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine
When she smiles oh it's time out of mind
When she smiles
Then she smiled and said where you been all my life
And she smiled when he asked her to be his wife
And the future had never looked so bright
When she smiled
I'm just diggin' her diggin' me diggin' her
When she smiles I forget my lines
When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine

Do you mean what you say
Do you say what you mean 
Or will you find another lie 
Another lie to hide behind
Keep speaking to the world about 
What you can't forget, you can't forget 
All the things you hold onto, 
Refusing to forgive those that hurt you

You're taking steps on a fine line 
So you don't have to choose a side
Good deeds are not recognized 
When the heart's intent is full of pride
You're taking steps on a fine line 
So you don't have to choose a side
Good deeds are not recognized 
When the heart's intent is full of pride
One day we hope you stop holding it on all in 
And learn to let go and forgive (forgive)",Metal,Electronic
"Hello
Now take me home
To the dream
Ever lasts just once

Clouds all around
Take away all my fear
Let me fall asleep

Let me fall asleep

Fall asleep

You have to let it go
Don't go
So hard to say goodbye

Woke up on return
Never woke up
He held on beyond one's voice

Felt all secure
Just adored
This beauty, stating
Oh so cold

It was getting cold

Is it cold?

You have to let it go
Don't go
So hard to say goodbye

So hard to say goodbye
You have to let it go

Well, they brought hearts and daggers, they wrote songs about you When they tied you up in the rungs of ladders And you never ended up coming home, you just Became something like some smoke that I tried too hard to hold And when I awoke, everything had changed you see, I Left my home, returned something different, I was Beaten to death, bleeding to death with regret And nobody else can see it But there's something underneath my skin And I wish I could tell you I had the worst little dream Well, they brought hearts and daggers, they wrote songs about you When they tied you up in the rungs of ladders And you never ended up coming home, you just Became something like some smoke that I tried too hard to hold And the black clouds came And darkened all our insides, there were Newspaper clippings with horrible headlines Of doom and despair and your name and my name said Who will save you from the truth of the matter That your love, though like gold, is gone? Well, they brought hearts and daggers, they wrote Songs about her, when they Tied you up in the rungs of ladders And you never ended up coming home, you just Became something like a dream I saw where they brought Hearts and daggers, they wrote Songs about you, when they Tied you up and you hung from ladders And you never ended up coming home, you just Became something like some smoke that I tried too hard to hold",R&B,Folk

"Abandoned by all her admirers,
Wild white shadow waltz
Stands alone on a stair down the hall,
Just one slip from a trip and a fall.

In a cold morning, holding her lighter,
One  white shadow waltz stirs, sputters, and stalls. 
Then wakes, wavers
And walks right through her prison walls.

She says, ""The doorbell is ringing.
Go see who it is.
Our little island's sinking into mist.""

A day came. A night went. It lightened.
An animal broke his way out,
Moped through the scattering crowd,
And crawled back to his circus shell.

And circling the zoo's screaming clients
Was white shadow waltz,
Deaf to their torn breaths and calls.
(Wait, take a look closer, he's hardly moving at all)

She says, ""There's someone is knocking,
Go see who it is.
Our little world is shaking,
I guess our little world is breaking.""

In the presence of all our despisers
We'll falter and crawl to our bed.
The world is a black shadow bled.
And what is this tune in my head?

She says:
""It's just the white wind when it whimpers.""
""It's just the black rain when it squalls.""
""It's just white meat whistling a waltz.""
""It's just nine hands wiping a white shadow off of the walls.""",Indie,Folk

Whole lotta curves on this girl, oh I'm confused
This bikini girl stand and watch me
I put the Shaka up cause she hot
Whole lotta salt in my veins I can't get out
And a whole lotta sunshine, and good times
Super beach kids with nothing but dark tans
Super beach kids with nothing but dirty vans
Woke up this morning on the sand
Still surrounded by my friends
And a bunch of empty soda cans
And something that the tide brought in
Beach love last night
Last night I found
Found my beach wife babe, my beach wife yeah
I surfed at least 3 hours today
And them bottom curves felt so amazing

Me and my chick
We both skate by

She's in denim shorts and dirty vans
She's got henna prints all on her hands

Real waves, I'm searching for them real waves, oh real waves

We are the thought provoking, softly spoken, heart wide open, chill emotion, kind of guys who shred on boards down in the ocean
Now let me take you boating
I have a notion, if you're tanning baby I'm your lotion
Just some beach kids actin' up, our wet suit's tailored up,
Shopping at vineyard vines, all my belt's whalered up,
This ocean stunt, we all got houses ocean front, nothing else is cool
Us surfer kids know how it's done
But I'm not done
I'm on, on one, one day watcha say
I'll take you down by the bay,
Lay a blanket and candles and a food tray
Serve you a little caviar and cheese
I'm just tryna please you, never leave you, I'm here to stay

Somewhere alone with you

You need a laugh

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",Jazz,Jazz
"I want my mind to pull me through
Up until now that's been hard to do
But how could I know, how could I know
It'd be easy

I want my heart to stand alone
To be the one that's made of stone
How could I know, how could I know
It'd be easy
Easy as falling apart

Woke from the sweetest dream
Brought to the floor
Robbed of the only thing
I'm living for

I want the sun to shine to shine on me
To show me the way and set me free
How could I know, how could I know

Everything you'd want

Breath comes sharp and heart beats faster

Cold ground for a pillow under a blanket of stars

In a love field
In a love field
Headlights that startled this embrace of ours
In a love field

In a crooked house where
Things can be arranged
You think you're different from the rest
But you don't see how you've changed

Under an archway on a road of white linen

I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some

Was a gun or a girl
Release, now I've thrown them away

And all that's left to warm your breast's the wine we stole tonight
Bottle merchants both of us, overdosed on Keats, we smashed them all
And watched them fall like magic in the streets

Standing in our new boots, we've lost the urge to hide
We left it with the souvenirs that forced us to decide
How we'd storm the palace, meet me at the gates?
There's plenty bread and water here for anyone who waits

Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in shame?
And if love can conquer all then why do we only feel the pain?

I heard you speak my name, heard you singing The Stones,
Maybe heard you laughing in a line of static on my telephone
So why your eyelids are closed, inside a case of rust,
And did you have to change all your poets fire into frozen dust?
I've tried to justify it, to learn from your mistake,
But where's the stupid lie that has to make it's point -
With such a pointless waste.
Come out...

Do you believe in shame?
Do you believe in love?
And if they taste the same would you love again or abandon both?

I don't think I ever can, belive my friend has gone,
Keep saying it's alright,
I'm going to bring you back but I know I'm wrong.
There's nothing I can say, there's nothing left to do
It's just that lately I feel so damn lonely when I think of you
And it may seem selfish now, but I'll hold on to the memory
Until all this fear is washed away
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in life?
'Cos I believe a little part of you inside of me will never die..

There sleeping with the aspergillus Is this justice to the dead ? The atrocious sight of burial ecremony Christians weeping for the departed They won't understand, they should envy them ! The deceased they know, if there's a paradise Or shall we feel, the purgatory ! I open the graves, admire the rot I can feel the presence, of something beyond Aureola of nauseating reek Wings of shriveled skin Holy beauty of a carcass Divine sight for me to gaze upon !

"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",Jazz,Jazz

From your home home high up off the ground
In the tree dark and forlorn
Where the rope hangs bruised and worn

Though I'll never fly to you
It's the last thing I would do
You have dug two holes so deep
I'm afraid that one's for me

Pretty Polly must I cry
Without your voice I'll fear I'd die
The song you sing and the story you tell
We must keep them to ourselves

Oh I know my voice like nightingale
Now I have my brand new tale
Of a tree dark and forlorn
Where a rope hang bruised and worn

Petty Polly, I have bread
That I have not eaten yet
Come and take them from my halls
Then we'll lay your song to rest

For I am hungry and grows late
I will eat your bread and then
I will sing my song again",Folk,Folk

Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

This heart of mine was doing very well.
The world was fine as far as I could tell.
And then quite suddenly I saw you, and I dreamed of gay amor.
At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.

"Run
Every second is a pure affliction
But I can feel your pain
Choke back the burn of wrath as they violate your name
No sign of innocence in this godforsaken place
When the truth is in your hands, they’ll spit upon your face
Dismantle the ground they stand on
Give power a name
You’ve traveled the path of slander
Now bury the shame
Shed rejection
Learn to follow the wolves
[Chorus:]
Run away to the blackened sky, through the fear of disbelief
Run away from the hollow cries, to the shelter of release
Run away to the blackened sky, through the fear of disbelief
Run away from the hollow cries, to immunity
See the struggle of the faithless lot as they negate their time
How low to sink to the depths of their frame of mind
Dismantle the ground they stand on
Give power a name
You’ve traveled the path of slander
Now bury the shame
Shed rejection
Learn to follow the wolves

Nearing the end of our misery

Inexpensive thrills

Fall in love Fell Falling

Love will tranquilize
Just before it kills

You turn them on

Who's satisfied doing good deeds anymore? Who grieves anymore? Who believes anymore? Who graduated school and still reads anymore? Not me, That should have my whole race shook, Cause we don't read novels, But we do face book, The new craze is having that new age look, If I said I liked it I'd feel like a 2 faced crook, Nah, I tell retro kids: ""Tie that bandana just a little bit tighter til it suficates you biter"" Cuz i dont wear bright colors or rope chains, I'm a G my daddy was in the dope game",Hip-Hop,Hip-Hop
"From the album fairytale

We stood in the windy city,
The gypsy boy and I.
We slept on the breeze in the midnight
With the raindrop and tears in our eyes.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,
For I'm going to try for the sun.
We huddled in a derelict building
And when he thought I was asleep
He laid his poor coat round my shoulder,
And shivered there beside me in a heap.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,
For I'm going to try for the sun.
We sang and cracked the sky with laughter,
Our breath turned to mist in the cold.
Our years put together count to thirty,
But our eyes told the dawn we were old.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done ?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,
For I'm going to try for the sun.
Mirror, mirror, hanging in the sky,
Won't you look down what's happening here below?
I stand here singing to the flowers,
So very few people really know.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,
For I'm going to try for the sun.
We stood in the windy city
The gypsy boy and I.
We slept on the breeze in the midnight,
With the raindrop and tears in our eyes.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done ?

That good sweet candy man's in town
It's the candy man
It's the candy man
He likes a stick of candy just nine inch long
He sells as fast a hog can chew his corn
It's the candy man

All heard what sister Johnson said
She always takes a candy stick to bed
Don't stand close to the candy man
He'll leave a big candy stick in your hand
He sold some candy to sister Bad
The very next day she took all he had
If you try his candy, good friend of mine
You sure will want it for a long long time
His stick candy don't melt away
It just gets better, so the ladies say

"I'll sing you this October song
There's no song before it
The words and tune are none of my own
For my joys and sorrows bore it

Beside the sea the brambly briars
In the still of evening
Birds fly out behind the sun
And with them I'll be leaving

The fallen leaves that jewel the ground
They know the art of dying
And leave with joy their glad gold hearts
In scarlet shadows lying

When hunger calls my footsteps home
The morning follows after
L swim the seas within my mind
And the pine trees laugh green laughter

L used to search for happiness
L used to follow pleasure
But l found a door behind my mind
And that's the greatest treasure

For rulers like to lay down laws
And rebels like to break them
And the poor priests like to walk in chains

L met a man whose name was time
He said I must be going
But just how long ago that was
L have no way of knowing

Sometimes l want to murder time
Sometimes when my heart's aching
But mostly l just stroll along
The path that he is taking

I'll sing you this October Song
There is no song before it
The words and tune are none of my own
For my joys and sorrows bore it

Beside the sea the brambly briars
In the cool of evening
The birds fly out behind the sun
And with them I'll be leaving

"First there was the fable of the bull
Told by the picador 
Then an Orwellian raping of a virgin apple core
An apple core, an apple core, an apple
Core, an apple core, an apple

Next our minds were supping up the horrors
That our vicious master's whip
Was serving us in rituals nefariously hip
Wickedly hip, wickedly hip, wickedly
Hip, wickedly hip, wickedly

I had to don a disguise to see her slinking down
The snaking hallways to her chamber
But I wasn't prepared to encounter the vision 
Of she and it engaged in defiling of the sacred
In an instant her face became so plaintive 
And I watched as she transformed
Into the Black Amaranth 

The next morning I espied
In a window framed in brass
The story of her condemnation
Portrayed in the stained glass
In the stained glass
In the stained glass, in the stained

"Heart be still my life is changing
No more waiting around to feel okay
Heart be still my mind is fading out into the stars guiding my way
Whether you leave, whether we love, whatever you say
Whatever you find, just know you got time to change

Maybe it's in our blood, maybe it's in the air
But something is waking up inside in the early morning
Well maybe we feel the sun, maybe we're all aware
And maybe all we need just comes without any warning
Maybe the stars are guiding our lives, they know we love them

We can't live this way forever
Lying together, forgetting who we are
We could leave and search forever
Wild winds keep bringing us back to where we start
Where the dream light comes apart

Be still baby, can't you see it coming around
We still maybe got to figure out somehow whether we fight
Whether we pause and make love to that sound
When the dream light comes around

Maybe it's time to question our eyes and answer our hearts
Maybe it's time to answer the signs we break apart
Maybe those lines were taking us out, dragging us down
Maybe those times were breaking our hearts, we're older now
Maybe those stars are shining our lights, giving us hope
Maybe those stars are guiding our lives, bringing us home",Indie,Indie

"I guess I'll miss the man
Explain it, if you can
His face was far from fine
But still I'll miss his face
And wonder if he's missing mine

He never smiled enough
But though his words were gruff
I liked his shy, sad glance
I never told him so
But then, I never got the chance

Some men are heroes
Some men outshine the sun
Some men are simple, good men
This man wasn't one

Wasn't one

His gloomy solitudes
His blunt and thoughtless style

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

All I ever will recall of my life

"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

He put her in a ranch house on a hill
She could see the valley barbecues
From her window sill
See the blue pools in the squinting sun

To keep out the unknown
And on every metal thorn
Just a little blood of his own

"This tie's fitting just a little too tight Might have had one too many last night I wonder if it's written all over my face It's been a little while since I've seen this place Still I'm sitting here in the back row Like a long lost son is come back home When I bow my head and taken off my hat A Sunday morning takes me back Growing up under that hometown church steeple Learning God hates sin but still loves people The preacher preaching 'bout the Promised Land And me thinking 'bout holding Jesse Lane's hand And one hot summer when I was thirteen Took my soul to the river and washed it clean Feels so good, Lord, why can't there be Seven Sundays a week? Well, I can still hear daddy singing strong and low It is well, it is well with my soul And mama laid up the Sunday best I can still count every flower on her blue sun dress I've done a lot of living since those days But a boy comes back when he's been raised Growing up under that hometown church steeple Learning God hates sin but still loves people The preacher preaching 'bout the Promised Land And me thinking 'bout holding Jesse Lane's hand And one hot summer when I was thirteen Took my soul to the river and washed it clean Feels so good, Lord, why can't there be Seven Sundays a week? It was soft ball games And it was true love waits And all of those amazing things About amazing grace Growing up under that hometown church steeple Learning God hates sin but still loves people The preacher preaching 'bout the Promised Land And me thinking 'bout holding Jesse Lane's hand And one hot summer when I was thirteen Took my soul to the river and washed it clean It feels so good, Lord, why can't there be Seven Sundays a week?

And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.

"I've traveled o'er this country wide seeking fortune fair
Up and down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere
From Portland East to Portland West back along the line
I'm going now to the place that's best that old hometown of mine

Eight more miles and Louisville will come into my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the hometown of my heart

There's bound to be a gal somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a traveling through the land
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand

Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam
The place that's right for that love sight is in those bluegrass hills
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville",Rock,Country

And when people start to sing
I will always cross my fingers tight
I'll remember everything

But I always make my wishes
For the same thing every time
If I live to be one hundred
If I ever get it right

My mind is racing with thoughts
And the songs that never end
And I prayed to God last night
Just before I went to bed

Even now I can't remember
A single word He said
If I live to be one hundred
If I get it through my head

I always think about you
And I have to close my eyes
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind

When you close your eyes at night
And you rise above your life
Do you notice there's an empty space
Where I wasn't by your side

Because I always dream about you
Every time I close my eyes
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind

I always make my wishes
For same thing every time
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind",Folk,Country

From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish you were here

Running over the same old ground
What have we found?

When she told me that she loved me
How unmoved and cold

What can you say
When a love affair is over

Now she's gone away
And I'm alone
With a memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look

"Many's the time I've been mistaken, and many times confused
Yes and I've often felt forsaken, and certainly misused
Ah but I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm just weary through my bones
Still you don't expect to be bright and bon-vivant
So far away from home, so far away from home

And I don't know a soul who's not been battered
I don't have a friend who feels at ease
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered or driven to its knees
But it's alright, it's alright, for we live so well, so long
Still, when I think of the road we're traveling on
I wonder what's gone wrong, I can't help it I wonder what's gone wrong

And I dreamed I was dying, I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
And looking back down at me, smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was flying, and high up above my eyes could clearly see
The statue of liberty, sailing away to sea, and I dreamed I was flying

But we come on a ship they called Mayflower

"Still can't believe it, can't stand to leave it
But I know the rules
We were doomed babe, too much too soon babe
Acting like fools
Tried to fly and climbed too high
We saw it all, we had to fall
But I swear it's true, was all for you
I swear it's true, was all for you
Making love all the time,
Never let the day go by, or a night
Sweet music in the dark
You always found the spark to light my light

The only one babe, to ever break my heart
Was you, such a shame,
Though guys never cry, but that'll be the day I die,
Speaking your name

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

A sad, sad, girl
She don't try to fight it
Won't try to hide it

Was it always so?
Did her heart start that low?
Did she always believe
Love always deceives?
Was it always so?

No matter what you do
She'll pay no mind to you
To make her know you care
Is futile as a prayer

She's a mining town
After the mine's shut down
Coal turned to diamonds
She won't let you find them
She's a mining town

Once in a long, long while
She might attempt a smile
But it works in reverse
She starts to hurt even worse

Sad, sad, girl
In a sad, sad, world
She won't try to fight it
Won't try to hide it

"Inner Meet Me, oh you can't decide 

Last night I dreamt somebody fell asleep between my knees
I couldn't help it that the facts were rejected by a boy who called me
Last night I dreamt somebody fell asleep between my knees
I couldn't help it that the facts were rejected by a boy who called me
Last night I dreamt somebody fell asleep between my knees
I couldn't help it that the facts were rejected by a boy who called me

She said to me
keep your head up
never show up
keep it all in
never dream alone
Play on a star
Moves too far
Say what you feel
Speak when you kneel
Never dream alone
Never dream alone

If you were feeling that the light is on the ceiling then you can't see past your nose
Cos what you're seeing is the man underneath the beam she's a fool below low
I never listen but the people they were christened I wonder who was the one
A better placement for the basement when he's chasing Mrs Mason when they're facing on the relation

She said to me
keep your head up
never show up
keep it all in
never dream alone
Play on a star
Moves too far
Say what you feel
Speak when you kneel
Never dream alone

"(Verse)
I'm not so sure if it's a gift
Or a curse that I have been given
To live with
Sometimes it's my only wish
That I didn't have to be so different
What's the reason
But you don't wanna be

Going through the motions
As a ship sets on the oceans
Passing you all by
You're standing on side
A spectator of your old life
Don't you think it's time
You take a ride

Why do you go on
Why do you go on
You should go for what you wanted all along
Why do you go on
Why do you go on
You try to feel it even when it felt so wrong
Instead of just going alone
Why don't you go alone
(Verse)
I want the world to sing along
But I'm not sure I can afford the costs
Without getting lost
I know that there's an easy way
But I'm not sure that I'm willing to play
I'm not so good at this game
'Cause I can be

I'm not saying it will be easy
But what choice do I have
I'll take head for being me oh no
For being somebody else
So I'll play with the cards
That I have been dealt
And I'll play my own game

Why do you go on
Why do you go on

"So the heart stolen songs
And the sirens sing along from out at sea
And we close our eyes and turn to watch them leave
You are not to blame for what happens to me

So you know where I'm from
And you know just what I've done and what I've seen
And what I will become if I'm cut free
And you are not to blame for what happens to me

And the feathers on your breath
Dance along the wind and cut my chest
I'd follow you down any rabbit hole
And the bruise beneath your eyes has been growing like the tide

Well no matter how this ends
They'll never be a crutch the way I am
I'd follow you down any rabbit hole
Come find me when I sleep
And tie anchors 'round my feet",Indie,Folk
"I'm gonna take you down Deep down to the front lines You woke up this morning Got yourself a gun, Mama always said you'd be The Chosen One.

You woke up this morning Got a blue moon in your eyes You woke up this morning Got a blue moon in your eyes When you woke up this morning everything was gone. By half past ten your head was going ding-dong. Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes, Like a voice trying to tell you there's something you should know. Last night you were flying but today you're so low Ain't it times like these that make you wonder if You'll ever know the meaning of things as they appear to the others; Wives, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers. Don't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you Didn't think beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink? Well you do so make up your mind to go on, 'cause When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone.

You're out of my heart

"And once I walked a million miles
All the way to Yugoslavia
And I carried you all of the way
For where I was then there you are.

As the sun rose o'er the curb stones
By the road where I'd been sleeping
Them night-long trucks, as they roared by
They could not drown my weeping.

And it was me, and I alone
Who looked toward the far horizon
And I saw King Heron
On his dead tree throne
And I knew not which to keep my mind on.

Now I cannot speak for everyone
For they got their reasons
All on this road
But, Heron, would that I had your wings
For then I'd know where I would go
For then I'd know where I would go.

"I see you crawl through the day

I see you blocking your way
I see you draining your fountain
I see you run from the mountain

What can I do?
I try to clear where you step
What can I do?
I try to hold up the mirror
What can I do?
You've been there before
Your destiny called
What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?

Why hide your fear in your heart

Why hold my tear in your cup
Don't slap my hand away
'Cause then what can I do?

I see you building a maze

I see you walk in a daze
I hear you shout when you're quiet
I see it all when you hide it

I try to clear where you step

"When you find that your mind
Keeps you worried and blue
You can always let your feet
Keep your disposition sweet

Want to see
What makes me feel the way I do?
Will you kindly cast an eye
On two good reasons why?

Happy feet
I've got those happy feet
Give them a low down beat
And they begin dancing

I've got those ten little tapping toes
And when they hear a tune
I can't control my dancing heals
To save my soul

Weary blues can't get into my shoes
Because my shoes refuse to ever grow weary
I keep cheerful on an earful of music, sweet
'Cause I've got hap, hap, happy feet, yes

Happy feet, happy feet, happy feet
We've got those happy feet
Give them a low down beat
And they begin dancing

We've got those ten little tapping toes
And when they hear a tune
We can't control our dancing heals
To save our souls

Weary blues can't get into our shoes
Because our shoes refuse to ever grow weary
We keep cheerful on an earful of music, sweet

"I must have been blind adoring the blues
In everything lies a small kind of truth
But than again,
Just when I thought you were staying for good
You left for no reason, was that all you could
You're still a man

It's not what I want
It's not what I need
Nothing but lies and way too much heat
Just when I thought you were telling the truth
I caught you with her, oh you fool

You hurt me
When I've got so much more to give
You hurt me
When I've got so much more to give

We live in denial, adoring what's new
In everything lies a small kind of blues
But than again,
Just when I thought you were leaving for good
You stayed for no reason although we were through
You're still a man

It's not what I want
It's not what I need
Nothing but lies and way too much heat
Just when I thought you were telling the truth
I caught you with her, oh you fool

Let me ride on the Wall Of Death one more time

Oh let me take my chances on the Wall Of Death

You can fly away on the Rocket or spin in the Mouse
The Tunnel Of Love might amuse you
Noah's Ark might confuse you
But let me take my chances on the Wall Of Death

On the Wall Of Death all the world is far from me
On the Wall Of Death it's the nearest to being free

Well you're going nowhere 
When you ride on the carousel
And maybe you're strong 
But what's the good of ringing a bell
The switchback will make you crazy.

You're a sight for sore eyes, yes you are

If you knew how many nights I spent holding you so tight

Then I'd wake up and we're still apart

Now you're really near and I'm really here

And I can wrap my arms around you, yes I can

This is just like I remember, no I think it's even better

Maybe even more than I can stand

Baby, it's good to be back, so good to be back

Baby, it's good to be back in your arms again

Baby, it's good to be back, so good to be back

Honey, it's good to be back with you, oh yeah

Well it's not the first time we've been apart

But as far as I'm concerned it's the last

I don't care what we have to do to stay together from now on

But those days away from you are past

'cause when I go through the day and I haven't seen your face

Seems like nothing that I do feels right

You're the one I wanna see when I wake up every day

You're the one I wanna kiss goodnight

Baby, it's good to be back in your arms again (ooh)

Honey, it's good to be back with you

So good, so good, so good, so good, so good with you, baby

So good with you

Why don't you start me up with just one kiss

That's just one of the things I've missed

You better kiss me once again 'til it finally settles in

Well, I think I could get used to this

Baby, it's good to be back in your arms again, I just got to say it

"Well, for one thing, there was a whole lot of guys Who would've liked to have been in my shoes But the upkeep on a woman like that Will give an old poor boy the blues Still the pleasure was worth the pain Of everything she put me through And I consider myself one of the fortunate few Yeah and another thing she wasn't just good looking Her imagination just wouldn't quit She'd make you do things you never thought about And things you wouldn't want to admit There must be somebody else out there That feels about her like I do And I consider myself one of the fortunate few It felt so good to hurt so bad The best and the worst that I ever had I know I bit off a little more than I could chew Still, I consider myself, one of the fortunate few Well, the last thing I'm gonna tell you Some things are better left unsaid A gentleman don't go talkin' about What happens in a woman's bed That's all I've got to say I'll leave the rest up to you But I consider myself one of the fortunate few",Jazz,Country
"As I breathe, my disease brings me to my knees
All you need is a taste it'll set you free
Your infection's my discretion honey, one in the same
Counting second 'til I'm medicated, fucked in the brain
I don't want this baby
I just need it
I got the white line fever
And an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole headed for hell
Then baby count me in
I sold my soul so long ago
A bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell
Then baby count me in
I sold my soul
Licking every drop of poison
Off a pocket of keys
While some daddy's little angels
Getting down on her knees
When the sun goes down
The filth roam free
You'll never find a finer specimen
Of filth in me
I don't want this
I just need this
To carry on
I got the white line fever
And an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole heading for hell
Then baby count me in
I sold my soul so long ago
A bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole heading for hell
Then baby count me in
Some have said that I'm the devil and it's just as well
Cause I've been through and burned down and rebuilt hell
With my heart in a vice
And a knife in my back
I've got a noose for the world, that I'm painting black
I got the white line fever
And an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole heading for hell
Then baby count me in
I sold my soul so long ago
The bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole heading for hell

like a sweater with holes.

New year's day.
The rain creeps in
through the crack in the door,
like the guilt that seeps
from my head to the floor.

New year's day, I'll wake up
in the same familiar way.
Where I end, we'll begin
we'll do it all over again.

from me
There's a place that kills
with walls that I know
I've got a coffin to sleep in,
it's not a bed but a hole.
This face in the mirror
just won't go away,
it hides in the room
stares me right in the face.
And it all fades...

in the same familiar way.
Where I end, we'll begin
we'll do it all over again

"Hi
Gray skies are gonna clear up
Put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up
Put on a happy face

Take of the gloomy mask of tragedy
It's not your style
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
You decided to smile

Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that full-of-doubt look
Slap on a happy grin

And spread sunshine all over the place
And put on a happy face

Gray skies are gonna clear up
Put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana splits and licorice
And you'll feel fine

I know a girl so gloomy
She never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing

I'm happy to do whatever I do for you

For you maybe I'm a fool
But it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand

But I ain't done nothin' so you ain't seein' nothin' no 
Packed me a bag of buddah but I ain't the high school shootah
I'm sure you got bigger fish to fry

Crooked cop leave me alone
Go find someone else to
Run your game on oh yea (that's my car)
Go and tell po' watchin' my spot
If you don't live here then you don't belong in my neighborhood no
Crooked cop leave me alone 
Go find someone else to run your game on yea
Go and tell po' watchin' my spot
If you don't live here then you don't belong in my neighborhood 
You don't belong in my neighborhood no no no

Oh royal leader of 
Fraternity brothers 
Is really just a game oh yea

You'd like to hang around and beat brothers down
But you don't wanna change things oh no
It must be a prerec ya 
Gotta be on a power trail
For you to even join the force
You gotta hate black of course
Won't be that way in the future
'Cause no ruler reigns forever
What will you do when
Its over watcha gonna do when the parties over yeah over yes

Go find someone to run your game on
Go find someone to fool around with
Go and tell po' watchin' my spot 
If you don't live here
Then you don't belong in my neighborhood

"When it's all said and done
They gon' wanna come
Once the battle is won
They gon' wanna come
But what use do I have for you then?
You were never there
when it was all happenin'
You weren't when with me shooting in the gym
But here you come runnin'
after we get to win
When it's all said and done
They gon' wanna come
Once the battle is won
They gon' wanna come
You are so predictable
You were so busy
but now you want tickets to the show
You wanna be a part of the crowd
But the only reason
is just the fear of missin' out
When it's all said and done
They gon' wanna come
Once the battle is won
They gon' wanna come
[Verse 3]
I said you don't need to worry about it
They won't get too far
Miss Maya said you better believe them
When they show you who they are
I'm not sayin' it's gonna be easy
But you gotta do what you know
People are like wind, yeah
They'll go wherever it blows

When it's all said and done
They gon' wanna come
Once the battle is won
They gon' wanna come
[Spoken Outro]
So I got a honest question
How many of y'all
Would ever go through your girl's phone?
I probably would not
I'm just, I just feel like if I'm supposed to know who's gonna come to me
I'm not going to look for it
Like, I'm straight, I don't wanna go through it",Indie,R&B

"My mother was a witch, she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried
Take her down now, don't wanna see her face
Blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

Make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice, take my time

Am I evil, yes I am
Am I evil, I am man

As I watched my Mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread
Takin' no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone
Help set you free.

Make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice, take my time

Am I evil, yes I am
Am I evil, I am man

On with the action now, I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before you, smell so sweet.

27 every one was nice, gotta see them,
Make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice, take my time

Am I evil, yes I am

"Two sets of taillights burn dim and divide,
Stretch for miles making track marks across what veins fail to carry.
You should have taken my keys while my hands were shaking.
You could have kept the dead gone, entombed in the soil of arms.

Raise the breathing abrasion with a turn of the key.
Lost motor skills and a set cruise control.
Mangled insect screams through the puddles of drool.
Mainline the highway baby,

Tie off the concrete veins and set the radio to FM
Love songs clocked relapse defined by the RPM's of a static heart,
Reanimated by the rush of eyes and horizon.
Nothing warms like a road flare when caution sets.

Anodyne seeps like dashed yellow lines through the withdrawn rearview addict.
Drenched to the drawn teeth in seething foam.
If you want me dead, you should have called me home.
Rumble strip as pulse prevents retreating eyes, dilate and close.

I can feel the dry heaves moisten, I can feel the blood withdraw.
You are my failed twelve step program.
A red light could kick this habit, a needle full of the junkies fuel.
Drops of blood on her fingertips.

Your arms are a deprivation chamber.
Sterile to sixty in forever flat.
Dissolve into the coast like John Wayne.
A hero and his heroine.",Metal,Indie

"I've never felt so warm
As I did the other night
We'd never make it anyway

We never were that real
With everything we've done
You think that there'd be something
Left for you and I

There's nothing left to fight about
Or to get all uptight about
So ladiday, let's go on holiday

I'm weathering the storm, I'm sounding the alarm
It's better now than later
While you never take the wheel
And tell me how it feels underneath the radar

I've never been that guy
Who'd make up reasons why
I've never been that all American

There's nothing left worth killing for
And I just can't take this anymore
Somebody needs to take a holiday

I'm breaking down the door, I'm sounding the alarm
It's better now than later
While you never take the wheel
And tell me how it feels underneath the radar

Maybe we just need a holiday
We just need a holiday
Maybe we just need a holiday
We just need a holiday

Maybe we just need a holiday
We just need a holiday
Maybe we just need a holiday
We just need a holiday

We just need a holiday
We just need a holiday

It's better now than later
While you never take the wheel
So tell me how it feels underneath the radar

I'm breaking down the door, I'm sounding the alarm
It's better now than later
While you reinvent the wheel
Just tell me how it feels underneath the radar

We need a holiday
We need a holiday
We need a holiday

"She's a girl
Rising from a shell
Running to spring
It is her time it is her time
Watch her run with ribbons undone
She's a rose in a lily's cloak
She can hide her charms
It is her right there will be time
To chase the sun with ribbons undone
She runs like a fire does
Just picking up daises
Comes in for a landing
A pure flash of lightening
Past alice blue blossoms
You follow her laughter
And then she'll surprise you
Arms filled with lavender
Yes my little pony is growing up fast
She corrects me and says
""You mean a thoroughbred""
A look in her eyes says the battle's beginning
From school she comes home and cries
I don't want to grow up Mom at least not tonight
You're a girl
Rising from a shell
Running through spring
With summer's hand in reach now
It is your time
It is your time
So just run with ribbons undone
It is your time yes my angel
It is your time
So just run with ribbons undone
Run run darlin'

But that was all before she came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now you're here it's not the same

She gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
She's all I got
She's all I got in this world
And she's all the woman that I need

And in the morning when I kiss her eyes
She takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
She holds me close and won't let go
She won't let go

She builds me up
She gives me love
More love than I've ever seen

"oooh
no one seems to think too much of me here
and they're glad to tell it to my face
and though i am not suppose to be here
i'm completely out of place
somehow there has got to be a reason
even as i try to think it through
there's a bold from the blue
and i see a shooting star
set apart from all the rest
while the other stars are standing still
he's on a quest
every night this shooting star
dancing across the twilight sky
cause he knows he doesn't quit fit in
and he's longing to know why
why
i feel so much better when it's night-time
that's when i can sort of disappear
when the sun is set and it's the right time
for pretending i'm not here
sometimes i just start into the heavens
wondering if the answer is inside
that's when i see the light
of my sent that shooting star
on his way to who know's where
he's a one like all the stars
but he outshines out there
and the solitary star
is an awful lot like me
on an endless search through time and space
far a place that won't seem wrong
if we both hang on for long enough
we both somehow are strong enough
we'll find out were we belong

Steady breakin' me on down, break break down,
Steady breakin' me on down,
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down,
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down.

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me,
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was o.k
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way?""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, c'mon

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the disguise of a smile

Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

It'll break you down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it

Taking me around

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise

Subhuman conditions are exposed
Sub-standard existence is lost
Hardening, a warrior is born
Seven pillars of wisdom

You are fallen heroes
You fallen angels
You are fallen traitors
You fallen kings
Fallen imperium, fallen imperium

I stare the abyss in its face
I'm burning you with my hate
Desolation they call this place
Witness hell, you maggot's race

Clean off the blood from my blade
Let it drop blood from my face

The new war ended but the threat remains
Our enemy has learned to live with pain
Confronting mutants going insane
Treacherous thoughts in your brain

Your fallen cities
Your fallen skies
Your fallen statues
You fall and rise

And turn them into art

There would be no place to start

You are dangerously wild
But you're sweeter than rock candy
And you ease my inner child

I am impatient, complicated
I am fragile deep within

And I'm no little girl

There is love in the world?

It's the way I lean my body towards you

"Words
My lips are moving and the sound is coming out 
The words are audible but I have my doubts 
That you realize what has been said 
You look at me as if you're in a daze 
It's like the feeling at the end of the page 
When you realize you don't know what you've just read 

I might as well go up and talk to a wall 
'Cause all the words are having no effect at all 
It's a funny thing...am I all alone? 
Something has to happen to change the direction 
What little filters through is giving you the wrong impression.
It's a sorry state 
I say to myself.

What are words for 
When no one listens anymore? 
What are words for 
When no one listens there's no use talking at all 

Pursue it any further and another thing you'll find 
Not only are they deaf and dumb 
They could be going blind

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

"I'm out to mix it up and change my complexion
To coat the feelings and cure my depression
A shot of petrol is my bonafide method
To lose control and get thoroughly distracted

I'm on the money, here I come
Fuel for my engine, and I'm gone

I like to forget why I feel this compulsive
As I toss tomorrow's dreams in the garbage
What's important is a mind that's sicker
Turning Jekyll into Hide much quicker

I'm on the money, here I come
Fuel for my engine, and I'm gone

One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four
Kick start and turn me over
Punch drunk, but I'm still sober
Fourteen years and a whole lot bolder
And I don't flinch
Hungry and I'll take the best
'Cause I never wanted anything less
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

It's like a war inside me, I'm good, I'm evil
Two sides of the coin and I've been blessed with both
On one hand I am you, but I don't like you
I guess that's the nature of the way things work

I'm on the money, here I come
Fuel for my engine, and I'm gone

One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four
Kickstart and turn me over
Punchdrunk, but I'm still sober
Bukowski's on my shoulder
With much to think
Hungry and I'll take the best
'Cause I never wanted anything less
What doesn't kill makes me stronger
It's like a war inside me, action is all I know
Tell me it's suicide, tell me something I don't know

I don't know why I've been made some kind of hero
When I've done all I can do to prove I'm not
It's amazing to think someone could trust me
Tell me what do you know about me really ?
And I you make the mistake of getting close to,
Me, you'll just give me all that you've got
So I don't know why I've been made some kind of hero
When I've done all I can do to prove I'm not

One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four
Kickstart and turn me over
Punchdrunk, but I'm still sober
Fourteen years and a whole lot bolder
And I don't flinch
Hungry and I'll take the best
'Cause I never wanted anything less
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

One, two, three, four, one, I can't close this broken door

It's just the nature of the way things work
You want to be me, I don't give a damn
Anyone can do it but it takes a man not to
Try so hard to give me a real life
Anyone can do it but it takes a man not to

An agent and a chef

And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist

"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top
To throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people are saying
My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining

May as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play

And as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me

In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? what do we do?

Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally",Jazz,Country

"Some sleepless night, 
If you should find yourself alone,
Let me be the one you run to,
Let me be the one you come to 
When you need someone to turn to, 
Let me be the one.

To set things right 
When this old world's turned upside down,
Let me be the one you run to,
Let me be the one you come to 
When you need someone to turn to, 
Let me be the one.

For love and understanding, 
To find a quiet place;
For silent understanding, 
A loving touch.
Come to me when things go wrong 
And there's no love to light the way.

Let me be the one you run to,
Let me be the one you come to 
When you need someone to turn to, 
Let me be the one.",Jazz,Jazz
"I found some shade beneath the willow tree I fell asleep and started dreaming That everything created here on Earth All had voices singing Every rock and every blade of grass Even the ivy that was clinging Every leap and every drop of rain All had voices singing It brought the angels down In my dream so clear And the Lord sat down. So that he could hear The sea and waves were rushing to the shore With the joy that they were bringing A sound so perfect that it made him cry To hear their voices singing I could not help but want to add my own To all the praises that were ringing And over all the world there fell a hust To hear my one voice singing And as the Lord sat down The angels hovered near But they made no sound So that He could hear Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, I heard voices singing Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, I heard voices singing",Country,Country

"As I look out on the sunrise on the Indiana skyline, and its rays are resting heavy on my face. I think about the days I spent Just wishing I was home again, Instead of always traveling place to place. I've been homesick because I've laid deep roots in Indiana soil where I spent up all my youth, and I've been waiting just to be back home again and feel the Indiana sun shine on my skin. As I look out on the sunset and I try hard not to forget, All the memories that I made while I was here. I think of all the friends I've made and all the people I should thank for lessons I have learned over the years. I've been homesick because I've laid deep roots in Indiana soil where I spent up all my youth, and I've been waiting just to be back home again and feel the Indiana sun shine on my skin. Home is where the heart's been waiting oh so patient, just to hear the sound of the back door open it's always open I've been hoping just to find my way back here again. Because I've been homesick because I've laid deep roots in Indiana soil where I spent up all my youth, and I've been waiting just to be back home again and feel the Indiana sun shine on my skin.

Dope boy, so I never have a problem in a drought
Don't take, too much work if you can't manage that
Just in case you run out of empties, use sandwich bags
Play with the hand you was dealt
That's why I ride the track 'til it melt

Threesomes in the trunk, I'm fuckin' for the wealth

Have your whole family missin' for thirty five G's, please
I perfected my craft from a different aspect

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Folk,Country

Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms
Through these fields of destruction
Baptism of fire
I've whittnessed your suffering
As the battles raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms
There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones
Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line on your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms",Rock,Folk

"A nocturnal concerto
Candlelight whispers me where to go
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide
As I wander on this path of the night
Embroidery of the stars
Undress my feelings for this earth
Send me your salva to heal my scars
And let this nakedness me my birth
Macrocosm poured its powers on me
And the hopes of this world I now must leave
The nightwish I sent you centuries ago
Has been heard by those
Who dwelled in a woe
The distance of our bridal bed
Await for me to be dead
Dust of the galaxies take my hand
Lead me to my beloved's land
Departed by the guillotine of death
I received a letter from the depth
The dream of my lover it carried inside
Caressed by the sharpest knife
I asked you to be my wife
Rays of the setting sun
Were my tears wept upon promises undone
Come to me
Make me believe
to you and your love again
Above the universe
Beneath the Great Eye
I shall desire you forevermore

"There was once a farmer, walking down the road whistling a tune to himself. 
He said, ""Dog-gone, I wish I had some words to that tune. 
But all I've got is the melody."" Just then he came to a little bridge, 
And he leaned on the railing looking down at the brook. 
There was a big old bullfrog, hopping from bank to bank. 

Well, the bullfrog looked up and saw the farmer and decided to show off. 
He took an extra special big hop - z-z-z-z-tt! 
He landed, splash! in the water and got himself all wet. 
The farmer laughed and laughed and started singing
""Way down south in the yankety-yank, a bull frog jumped from bank to bank, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do! 
He stubbed his toe and fell in the water,
You could hear him yell for a mile and a quarter, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do.""

Now the farmer went walking down the road 
Feeling mighty proud of himself for making up a song. 
He went down to the corner store, bought himself some groceries, 
A pair of work gloves and a plug of chewing tobacco, and said, 
""Oh, before I go, I have to sing you my new song.""

""Go on home,"" says the storekeeper, 
""I'm busy here, can't you see all these customers?""

""I won't pay you any money unless you let me sing you my song!""

""Well, sing it and get it over with then,"" 
Said the storekeeper.

The farmer began to sing and the man in the store cried out, 
""That's a w-o-o-nderful song, gather round everybody, 
We'll have a party."" And he passed round the free Coca Colas 
And the free soda-crackers, and everyone was stamping on the floor.

Meanwhile, all the wives and children back home 
Were sitting down to supper, and, where's father?

The mother said, 
""Children, you better run down to the corner store and fetch your old man. 
He's probably down there wasting his time as usual.""

So all the children run down the road. 
They run inside the corner store. 
You know, they heard all that music, 
They forgot about coming home. 
The children started singing 

And they were passing around the free Coca-Colas and 

Now, in every farmhouse it was the same situation. 
The mother said to themselves, ""This has gone far enough. 
Supper's getting cold. 'Spect us to work all the day nobody show up?""

They reached over on the stove 
And grabbed some heavy frying pans 
And start down the road with a mad look in their eyes. 
Somebody's going to get beaned.

Well, they get near and they hear all that pretty music, 
And they forget all about being mad. 
They drop the frying pans in the gutter, 
Walk into the store, and the mothers start singing! 
Way down yonder in the yankety-yank, 
A bullfrog jumped from bank to bank 
And they're passing round the free Coca-Colas 
And the free soda crackers, 
And everybody is stamping on the floor!

Meanwhile out in the barns all the cows started talking, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be milked and it's getting mighty uncomfortable!"" 
So the cows left their stalls, they wobbled out of the barn, 
And down the road right into the corner store. 
And the cows started singing, 
""Moo, moo, moo, moo, moo moo, moo, moo, moo, moo."" 

And the cow's tails were swishing out the windows, 
And they were stamping on the floor,
And drinking the free Coca-Colas and eating the free soda 

Out in the barnyard all the chickens said, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be fed and we're getting hungry!"" 
So the chickens hopped over the fence, 
Hopped down the road, hopped into the store, 
And the chickens started; (Chicken imitation to tune). 
And the chicken were stamping on the floor and drinking the free Coca C 

Meanwhile all the barns started talking to each other. 
""We feel mighty lonely,"" they said, ""without any cows or any chickens. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
So the barns picked themselves off their foundations and galumphed down the road, 
And s-q-u-e-e-z-e-d themselves into that corner store, 
Believe it or not. Did you ever hear a rusty hinge on a barn door? 
That's the way the barns sang

Out in the fields all the grass says, 
""Where is everybody? The cows are supposed to come and eat us. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
And the grass picked itself up and swished off down the road, 
And swished right into the store and started singing

Of course, when the grass was gone, the fields were gone, 
So the brook didn't have any banks to flow between. 
It said, ""I've got to go someplace,"" 
So it bubbled down the road. 
It bubbled right up into the corner store and the brook started
Bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl.

The brook was bubbling up and down the stairway! 
The grass was growing out the chimney! 
Feathers flying through the air! 
Cows tails swishing through the windows! 
Everybody stamping on the floor 
And drinking the free Coca-Cola 
And eating the free soda-crackers!

Meanwhile, there's the bullfrog in mid-air!

He looks down, there's nothing underneath him. 
He looks over and there's no bank to land on. 
He says, ""Where am I?""
And he starts hopping down the road. 
Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!

""Hey, what's all that racket down at the corner store?"" says the frog.

""Why 
They're singing! 
They're singing about ME!"" 
And he was so proud he puffed himself up with pride.

And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he boom!

He exploded. 
Cows, barns, chickens, farmers, the whole corner store went up in the air, 
And everybody floated down 
And landed right where they were supposed to have been all the time. 
They all sat down eating supper again, 
Feeling kind of foolish for themselves.

Next day they went out to find the frog. 
They looked high, they looked low. 
Coca-Cola bottles and soda crackers in all directions. 
But no frog.

So all there is left of the frog is the song. 
We might as well sing 'er once again.

You move in circles
Hoping no one's gonna find out

Crashing upon the desert plain

Waiting to descend again

I took for granted

All you had planted in my life

For me to enjoy

Since I was a little bitty boy

Now my eyes are open so I can see

All you've done for me

You've made my life complete

Oh what joy tome you bring

So forever I lift my voice and sing

It's all about you

I'm so glad that I have found

The one who turned my life around

Made my world a better place to live

It's all about you

I'm so glad you came this way

Made my darkness turn to day

Now it's for you I will live

Whenever I think how good you've been

In spite of the sins

Or all the wrong i've done

I can't help but cry and ask lord why

You show me love unconditionally

In spite of

Now i'm taking this stand

Holding up my right hand

And for all of my days

I'll give your name the praise

Oh, what joy to me you bring

And forever I lift my voice and sing

I live, for you, I breathe, for you

Have my being, for you

All I do is for you

I sing, for you, on my job, for you

In the mall, for you

All I do is for you

I sing, for you

Do my dance, for you

Lift my hands, for you

All I do is for you

"If all you keep hearing it so long you will see me as a super star
And you'll have time to waste with your minions and tink
I see your face in front of me,
Still grainy from that old black and white tv
My whole family silenced,
Watching you shape destiny with your 2 hands,
Faster than the eye can see.

Mesmerizing
You know what skinny little me started to struggle,
10 years old suddenly bold
Cause i resolved to live like my hero in the ring,
Be smart never give an inch,
No retreat when i'm wrapped up
Respect from teachers, red necks
And creatures who attack in a pack
Like incensed never seen the light not before or
Since a young prince
And i remain convinced of his invincibility
Athletic agility, virility,
Seen your free spirit for every through eternity stings
Like a bee Mr. Muhammad Ali

I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!

Your achievements defy belief from the belly of the beast rising like yeast,
My release from low self esteem
Came when i saw you rapping on my tv screen.
Float like a butterfly,
That describes my walk to school after fight night
I felt so cool cause i was at place too,
Love myself born slippy
Outta love for you,
And i knew that someday people would love me too.
None of that heckling about my black skin got through,
I would walk bare foot through hell for you,
It was how i felt back then i would still do for you,
So accept these humble words of praise,
And my gratitude for those glorious days
And your victorious ways,
Instilled in the young minds,
Skill sublime yours to mine!

Pulled up bumping the mutherfucking Cube. Walked in the door seen my face on the tube. Stood there and tripped off the gaffle video. It went off, I looked up and said its time to go. Girl said she was hungry so I tried not to be evil. I said you got a choice, Louie's burgers or Golden Eagle. She started biffing, I said bitch i ain't playing. It ain't like your my woman, why'knowutumsaying? Girl got the grub and it was off to the liqour store. I said what kind of drinks, she said go with the 4-0 I said what? grab one or two? She said get two, one for me and one for you. Got her to the room and she started to guzzling the forty, hit the blunt and the bitch was buzzing. that's when I told her it was time to come to Eiht. And I was about to bounce, rock, roll, and skate. Got inside, got to spanking on that ass. Her engine got hot, she start moving real fast. that's when I knew, she started to feel it. I grabbed them shoulders, said 'geah, can I kill it.' Geah, still breaking them off, why'knowutumsaying. Baby, why'knowutumsaying, ain't no faking. I'm here to break you off proper. All them other niggas be drag, why'knowutumsaying?

So don't perpetrate, just give it to the Eiht. Called up this bitch, I was already fucking. That made it easier to get her head ducking. Told her we was fixing to have this little get together. She started dragging about the movies, I said hmm whatever. Told her I pick her up about 9:30. I called up this other bitch, ""damn Eiht you dirty"" Pulled up bumping, like flaunting my riches. Ran out about I'd say 8 different bitches. They hung on my window, leaned on my hood, Sat in my seat. Got the raise in my meat. I just had to know if they was skeezing. I ran the line, 'what's the plan for the evening'. Right then, yo, the shit was all plugged. And after the night was over she'd be dug out by a brother who wasn't saying a word. Cause what I needed to say was already heard. Picked the bitch up and went straight to get the liquor. Then right back to my pad, so I could smooth dick her. Told her a drag, it went straight to her head. Cause if I said I just want to fuck my drag would be dead. She downed one cup, then 2 then 3. And Eiht was ready to shake the [huh?] And while I'm in it, I'll ask her can she feel it? Damn, can I kill it? Geah, why'knowutumsaying? Killing it all off.

"They say you're nothing but a party girl
Just like a million more all over the world
I know I shouldn't be raising my hopes so high
But I have seen the hungry look in their eyes
They'd settle for anything in disguise of love
Seen the party girls look me over
Seen 'em leaving when the party's over
They can't touch me now
You say you don't mind
We're so hard to find
I could give you anything but time
Give it just one more try
Give it a chance
Starts like fascination
Ends up like a trance
Oh you'll never be the guilty party girl
Maybe someday we can go hiding from this world
Maybe I'll never get over the change in style
But I don't want to lock you up and say you're mine
Don't want to lose you or say goodbye
I'm the guilty party and I want my slice
But I know you've got me and I'm in a grip-like vise.
They can't touch me now
You say you don't mind

"I was hanging with some friends of mine
We were all having a real good time, yeah
I saw a girl who was so very fine
I started waving my hands, my arms, my head

Got the nerve; found the words to say
But to my surprise she was passing
I mean it was strange `cause she just walked away
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

Now you're nervous with the fever
Body beat and never quit
I'm in heaven when I see her
Won't you talk some little things?
Hope she talk to me

I can't hear (What cha gonna do?)
You can't sit down like no one all by yourself
(I just wanna talk to you) And nobody else, yeah

I just wanna tell her
She's the girl of my fantasies
How we meet in my dreams every night it seems
And how love can be, I wanna (love you)
I'm gonna be (your love)

It's not everyday we see the one
That your heart's been likely dreaming of
There's that look in her eyes, so I don't know why
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

She pretends she doesn't see me
Leaves me standing in the rain
`Cuz I know she wants to meet me
She's just playing silly games

I said girl (What cha gonna do?)
Wanna show you a love that you just gotta see
(I just wanna talk to you) But she won't talk to me

And ooh, I'm telling everyone
I'm not dreaming anymore
`Cause I know she won't talk to me now
And at least she can't say no

And I'm going crazy
Trying to make her notice me
I go up, I get down, I turn all around
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

I said (Hey there baby)
I said (Hey there girl)

"(Music: Marillion Lyrics: Steve Hogarth & John Helmer)
Saw you walking on your velvet lawn
Is it lonely on the moon?
You took a dive and swallowed all you could
Did you drink too much too soon?
Nothing left for you to fight about
And no-one wants to see you try
The nearest neighbours are a mile away
Does the ocean hear you cry?
Punching at the sky
They say the King is losin' his grip again
They said you're bullet proof, they said you feel no pain
It seems the hero is misunderstood again
Is it love or is it surgery
Makes he seem so ill at ease
As she's begging you to please calm down
In her silk Armani on her knees
Did you carry out those threats I heard
Or were you only playing macho?
And the stains on her Versace scarf
Were they really just Gazpacho?
They say the King is watching his back again
They say the King is losing his grip again
Raging like a bull to an empty ring
D'you think they will forgive a hero anything?
Now the ring is just a band of gold
And your wife needs police protection
While you're sparring with the journalists
You're trying to win back her affection
Is this what it means to be a man boxing up all your emotion
So now she's gone and you're alone at last
You can tell it to the ocean
They say the King is losing his grip again
They say the King is countin' his numbered days
You never lost a fight in your whole life
You never had no trouble sleepin' through the night
The bottle and the doctor get you through the day
The boys who run the house'll make it all OK
You think they will forgive a hero anything
Maybe Hollywood..

Now the ring is just a band of gold....",Rock,Rock

I got something I´m gonna stick in you
I couldn´t give a flying toss ´bout the relatives you lost
I think it´s better that
Your bloodline stops from here
On in and
Whoops there I go again

Drop a row

You said kicking shins in the clock end
Was just a phase so I paged ya
And you became my new best friend

Should have known but worshipped a few

I bring the fire from the hell
I am a demon warrior
Listen for this doom bell
It tolls for this burning torch

I bring this torch from the flames
From the flames of Inferno
I bring the end for the days
Of angels' existence
I hunt those white dressed creatures
Creatures with their white wings
My own wings are black skin
And my claws steel

When I meet the angels of the light
I show no mercy for them
I tie them with barbed wire
And then crucify
I cut the veins of heaven's creature
I spill the holy blood
I am the tormentor of saints
And judge from hell

My dark and evil wrath is huge
I have ripped countless angels
And I have brought the fuel
For inferno's high flames
Those flames are getting higher
Til they reach those golden gates
And my deepest desire
Is to destroy all beyond those gates

Lighting up the weather wings
Tearing the burning corpse
And the choir of heaven sings
No, no more",Metal,Metal

"See her how she flies
Golden sails across the sky
Close enough to touch
But careful if you try
Though she looks as warm as gold
The moon's a harsh mistress
The moon can be so cold

Once the sun did shine
Lord, it felt so fine
The moon a phantom rose
Through the mountains and the pines
And then the darkness fell
And the moon's a harsh mistress
It's so hard to love her well

I fell out of her eyes
I fell out of her heart
I fell down on my face
Yes, I did, and I, I tripped and I missed my star
God, I fell and I fell alone, I fell alone
And the moon's a harsh mistress
And the sky is made of stone

"Flawless, so red raw, and real, 
The beast of the street, 
Speaks faceless to me. 

Fierce, the deepest of depths, 
Sends daggers and fire, 
From each shearing end. 

Summons, outcry for battle, 
Living illusion, 
Straight to the heart. 

I enter, sanctuary, 
They bury, the dead. 

Makes way, for the pain and promise, 
Dawning devotion, 
Numbing all in dismay - Stands alone. 

Lash out, strength in submission, 
Giving to exploits, 
A swift sudden death. 

Swarming, hybrids of exile, 
Outlaws in anthem, 
Sketched even in script. 

Screams clean, 
Sincerity - To break the crisis, 
Of a vacant past. 


(Words of wisdom, Words as weapons) 

Destroyer - Your course remains unscathed. 
Destroyer - Your course is unscathed. 

I enter sanctuary, 
They bury the dead. 

As the abyss - Is filled and forgotten. 

Conviction, The sign of its times, 
Translates the quarrel, 
With no objection. 

And issued, Sarcasm and war, 
To this distant boy, 
With more desperate needs. 

My commune, 
Safe haven, 
Secures my temperament, 
And in retrospect, I prevailed, 
With the ones who saved my life.

"T'was midnight on the stormy deep
My solitary watch I'd keep
And think of her I'd left behind
And ask if she'd be true and kind

I never shall forget the day
That I was forced to go away
In silence there my head she'd rest
And held me to her loving breast

Oh Willy don't go back to sea
There's other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don't go where the bullets fly

The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other's bride
But still my thoughts will oft times stray
To be with thou so far away

I never have proved false to thee
The love I gave was true and kind
But you have proved untrue to me
I can no longer call thee mine

So fare-thee-well I'd rather make
My home upon some icy lake
Where the southern sun refused to shine
Then to trust a love so false as thine",Folk,Folk
"The Liquidator 
Will soon be coming around
You won't feel safer 
Until you get out of town
He's an eraser 
He'll rub you out like a light
And for a chaser 
He'll kiss your woman good-night
He's a jackal and a Romeo, you know 
The devil in disguise
There's no telling where a girl would go, you know 
To gaze into his eyes
With the snapping of the fingertips of him 
He'll take your life away
And a whisper from the smiling lips of him 
Will take your wife away
The Liquidator 
Will soon be getting to you
You'll wake up later 
Somewhere up in the blue

I can't imagine what it's like to be you.
It's a mystery to me every day,
And I've got to get away.

For the race they put on over in Kentucky.
It's lovely at this time of year, so they say,
And I've got to get away.

I'm a dreamer, and you know
I'm a schemer with an eye for a show.
It's my imagination when I get low,
And the truth is I don't think I'll ever go.

When the music's playing, that's when it changes,
And no longer do we seen like total strangers.
It's all those words which always get in the way
Of what you want to say.

When I wake up in the morning
I think it only fair to give you warning
I probably won't go away,
I'll more than likely stay.

That I will come to the day when my heart stops to beat
And cope with the fact that I'll leave you to be

No road is too long you, have given me peace

You came into my life when it was down on zero
I will never surrender this fight
I will stay till the end of the line

Every little piece of my heart belongs
To you, I'll carry on
For you I'll sacrifice myself
Destiny was there to abandon me
You're my eternity, the reason I fight
Instead of just break down and cry

There is this force of your presence; my fuel to be free
As I step into a void no predictions in sight
I never be lonely with you by my side

Indescribable motion, a conjuction with fate
I wanna give you the stars like you show me the world
The meaning of life is your love in return

Like I am back from the dead, you came close to my heart
Made a bond that will never be torn apart
I will never surrender this fight

"I told him my biggest secret
And he told me four
He smiled at me and said that makes me love you more
And then he made me laugh
And I knew it was a sign
That he was a man
That I wanted in my life

I feel more and more of that way

And he accepts me, he never hurts me

And he will listen to every line
And even when I'm wrong, he is still kind
He chooses his words wisely when he tells me I'm not right

But he is also a beautiful friend

He heals me
He knows the real me
And he accepts me, he never hurts me
He heals me
He knows the real me
And he accepts me, he never hurts me

He has so much compassion in his eyes
I have no idea, how long he'll be here
A season or a lifetime, forever or a year
But for the first time in my life I'm not worried about the future
Because we have such a wonderful time when we're together
However things turn out, it's all right
Cause he's already changed my life

i am the ghost of better past lingering deep down
south of here
where we know his face
but not the name of a brother drowned in his last years
have you been skipping stones across the lake ablaze
for your own damn sake
open wide
it's this taste we've all been tasting in our tongues and in our minds
and take that head of yours and stick it through the clouds
you've been buried underneath our world
with all your selfish doubt
feel the heat dripping from our dirty tongues
gathering flames now
just last year we felt the hell of a sneaky spark
let it burn us to the ground
there's a hole in all there is to see in these waking days
and it's all fake
open wide
the taste we've all been tasting in our tongues and in our minds
and take that head of yours and stick it through the clouds
you've been buried underneath our world
with all your selfish doubt
by the time you turn the clocks all back
you'll be covered in all the leaves
it's a shame you didn't look around
oh
all the things you'd see
defeat the low",Indie,Indie
"Crushing into the cranium
Of a brain gone far beyond
Our images of chaos
Long before we walked on down

Defile the senses
While feelings travel through the space
Recoil the reflexes
To the subjugated of a race

You will gather there tonight
You can hear the bullets of my cry
We will turn our amps to ten
The battle will start all over again

Disorder of the order
Into present now
Disorder of the order
A madness will last

Gates of hell are open now
We won't be your fuckin' clown
Reign of terror will begin
We promise it's not the world's end

As the order of life
Slowly fades away
The ship docks at the bay
Slowly fades away

Disorder of the order
Slowly fades away
Will arise from the past
Slowly fades away

Disorder of the order
Into present now
Disorder of the order
A madness will last

Diluting the insanity of the world's scare
Diffusing the reaction
Deviating from obscure normality
The master pleads temporary insanity

they've gone and changed the rules again
cos in my life I'm trying hard
to do it all so I can remain
healthy and sane
I'll live forever, always one more tomorrow

I heard it on the radio
too much of what they said wasn't so
and now we've got to do those things
that they thought before were so wrong
to be healthy and strong
and live forever, always one more tomorrow
living forever, always one more tomorrow

I know we don't believe you

"This dream can't be
What it used to be, ever again

I don't want this dream or the grievance it brings
Can't justify greed at the cost of equality
Tangled in endless archaic chains 
Of power, profit, gain
What about the poor bearing poverty's marks
What about the sick whose lives are torn apart
What about those whose rights aren't respected
A nation of youth dejected

It's time to rethink this dream you call American
Corrupt beliefs, that some will call their heritage

A burdened soul once searching for liberty
Crowned in debt as the new face of slavery
Died by design with a senseless hope 
And a never ending rope
What about the leaders abusing authority
Corrupt moral compass guarded bureaucracy
What about those who died so we can live our complacency must end

It's time to rethink this dream you call American
Corrupt beliefs, that some will call their heritage
This dream can't be
What it used to be, ever again

Spirits of the slain hiding in the corners of my mind
Screaming when I kneel to look inside 
Stomach fucking turning and now it's disconcerting
Fight fire with fire you'll see everyone's burning

Turn on the TV for the murder spree
Get distracted while they take your civil liberty
Thoughts and prayers again, is that what it'll take?
Which industries profit while lives are at stake 

Now hear the media fools discuss the killer's mind
Starring at the screen to tell us what they find
Manifesto, dollar, worship get on your knees
So they can sell us a cure for the American disease

It's time to rethink this dream that they call American
Corrupt system of beliefs, some will call their heritage
It's time to rethink this dream that they call American
So one day it can mean something real again",Metal,R&B

I long to feel you in my arms again

Really, really wish you'd come home
Savin' my heartbreak for you
Makes me blue, sadder than blue

I still remember the scent of you dear

Feel like hell every day
Hopin' I get through to you
'Cause I sure miss you

You and I were living alone together
We held each other in the middle of the night
And swore we'd somehow make it better
We set our sights on the big city lights
No moss on these rolling stones
And here we are with everything we ever wanted
But now we're together alone
Gotta break out of this place we're in
Running out of time and out of sin
We were living smoke and mirrors anyway
Gonna drive all night 'til we disappear
Chasing down the miles so far from here
As the smoke and mirrors start to fade away
We're still the same
I remember thinking we could make it out somehow
If somehow we ever took a chance
We packed up what we had and threw it in the trunk
Didn't give our life a second glance
Now the days roll hard and the nights move fast
They say be careful what you wish
But having everything means nothing to me now
What we had is everything to miss
Gotta break out of this place we're in
Running out of time and out of sin
We were living smoke and mirrors anyway
Gonna drive all night 'til we disappear
Chasing down the miles so far from here
As the smoke and mirrors start to fade away
You know we're still the same..

Gonna drive all night 'til we disappear

they're waiting for spring to come
smoking down the track
the world could come to an end tonight
but that's all right
she could still be there sleeping when i get back. i and i
in creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one say to the other
no man sees my face and lives. noontime
and i'm still pushing myself along the road
the darkest part
into the narrow lanes
i can't stumble or stay put
someone else is speaking with my mouth
but i'm listening only to my heart
i've made shoes for everyone
even you
while i still go barefoot. i and i
in creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one say to the other

"When I was younger, a part-time job worker
Department store centre, I saw a man enter
He was middle-aged, deep lines on his face
Tight mouth and eyes glazed
Eyelids just half-raised

And I looked at him, he looked at me
He looked so sad, I had to see
What did he want, what could it be
What had he been through before me seeing him
In the store I worked for that year, that year

Ice skates he asked for, In the middle of summer
He wanted a good pair, the price he did not care
I looked for his size, our best pair he tried
Costom back and sides, excitement in his eyes

I asked are you a pro, he looked sad and said no
These skates are my last hope
Without them i cannot cope

And he said my wife, she drowned this summer
Behind our house, the river took her
I cannot swim, I need to find her
I will wait till it freezes over

And then I will skate, as far as it takes
I will skate as far as it takes, to bring her back home
To bring her back home, to bring her back home
Back home",Pop,Indie
"Took a look at this morning's paper same old story as before Headline read some crazy dictator trying to start another war I can't wait for the day when the bad guys finally lose And ordinary heroes make the news Extra, extra read all about it mother of four Takes a part-time job, does the shopping folds the laundry When her man works late she keeps his dinner hot Don't you know if it were up to me I'd give credit where credit is due? And let ordinary heroes make the news I'd turn on the tube but what's the use I know what I will see Another madman's on the loose and we're the ones who set him free I wish someone could talk some sense into those TV crews And let ordinary heroes make the news Eye-witness report tune in at ten man gets up And goes to work again, slaves all day to cover them bills Don't want to pay his taxes but you know he will If I had a camera and a satellite I'd give the world a better point of view And let ordinary heroes make the news",Country,Folk
"(Julie)
It's the voice of my one love
And it promises ecstasy
Day and night it is calling me
But I'm afraid to go

(Julie)
Though I run to escape it
Still it calls irresistibly
And although it's my destiny
Sorrow is there, I know

Warm are his arms, tender his kiss
But in his eyes hidden, the danger lies

(Julie)
Must I go where he leads me?
Though it be through eternity
Oh, I know I will never be free
Free from the voice that calls

"Love, you made me pay an awful price
I tried to gamble with you, but you were using crooked dice
Somebody's gotta suffer, somebody's gotta feel some pain
If it's gonna rain down misery, why it's all gotta fall on me?

Money, you made me some very good friends
Just like you make them, you're gonna break them in the end
Somebody's gotta suffer, somebody's gotta feel some pain
If it's gonna rain down misery, why it's all gotta fall on me?

I've had my share of love, life and money
I lost it all three ways and I'm here to tell ya it sure ain't funny
Me and my money parted, so did my love and I
Life don't mean a thing, and I wish that I could die

And life, you make a whole lotta fools
'Cause you're always teaching something that they never teach in schools
Somebody's gotta suffer, somebody's gotta feel some pain
If it's gonna rain down misery, why it's all gotta fall on me?

"Marine monster stuck in Indian summers
And damns on the line but funny is the photo
It's floating away, going away on the tide
Crystalized wished like kids cried for Christmases
Ticking off lists with the pens and the fists
Before floating way, going away on the tide
On the back of a beast and in that charge
Down a broken beach, the little stars
They spin the shots, the shards light on down
To the mouth of the sea and the morning comes
And in they carve the edge of the world
And the locks of fire go lying around
What when you heard it say forward first
Transfer through the person, a mystical blur
Got you going away, floating away on the tide
Everybody ran basements, and pit falling caves
And crackling tapes cause faints
Well, this songs means I'm going away, I'm floating away on the tide
Down the bloody beach with a burnt out car
So little I see, there are slicked out stars
All screaming for a distant, high roof
And the fizzed out snow, look out, folks scream
And saw a broken ghost in an old soap scene
' out, follow my rules
I had a vision of everything hidden
But always around me, it fought me, it found me
While floating away, going away on the tide
Shooting through time while my eyes getting glassy
And land while I watched seasons rocketing past me
They're going away, a little more every day, all the time
On the balcony in the brilliant sea where 'need
A voice spoke to me and said these things just gotta be
I don't know why, and I said here's to the freeway flasher
Here's to the desperate dasher, gone, I'mma keep him from crashing on
And stay one, I know you think you miss him
I know you think you knew him
But you were just passing through the light
And he is leaving now, he's gone",Indie,Indie
"The motorway won't take a horse 
The wanderer has found a course to follow 
The traveller unpacked his bags for the last time 
The troubadour cut off his hand and now he wants mine 

Oh no, not me. 

The circus girl fell off her horse and now she's paralysed 
The hitchiker was bound and gagged, raped on the roadside 
The libertine is locked in jail 
The pirate sunk and broke his sail 

But I still have to go 
I've got to go, so here i go 
I'm going to run the risk of being free 

The magicians secrets all revealed 
And the preachers lies are all concealed 
And all our heroes lack any conviction 
They shout through the bars of cliche and addiction 

So i've got to go 
I've got to go, so here i go 
I'm going to run the risk of being free 

And in this drought of truth and invention 
Whoever shouts the loudest gets the most attention 
So we pass the mic and they've got nothing to say except: 
""Bow down, bow down, bow down to your god"" 
Then we hit the floor 
And make ourselves and idol to bow before, 

Well i can't 
And i won't 
Bow down 
Anymore. 

No more",Folk,Folk

Ain't got to listen to no bitches and I'm disrespectin' laws, just doin' it the Bone Thug way. Yeah, nigga, you got to be crazy, fuckin' with Layzie, and all these Mo Thug killas.

Nigga, what? They sayin' that Bone was split up. Niggas is jealous, tellin' rumors and lies, can eat a dick up, nigga. Wish Bone: Nigga, stay real. Thugs get high. While you call yourself a thug, that's how I feel inside. And we don't wanna hurt nobody, -body, but your fuckin' with us, and we shootin' up the party. Even if we're solo on some of that Bone shit we sayin', now you can bring it on, because we ready, we ready. Fuckin' with us is like fuckin' with no condom. That's dumb, better play with yourself. Nigga, I ain't the one. Ain't a thang changed: niggas still the same--made a little change, sendin' bullets to brain, fuck around, man. Nine millimeter, come and get some, get some. Shoot 'em with them hollows, 'cause you know he's got his vest on. And you didn't want it to come to this, did you? Fuckin' with them thugs: them niggas roll through. If you really want some, run [Krayzie: you better run], fuckin' with thug niggas--run, run. Krayzie: Yeah, and nigga, come on. We ready for combat, but y'all ain't ready. Carry a deadly machete, shred 'em and stretched, now they human spaghetti, steady smooth and very eager to bury enemies. If it be necessary, then nigga wet 'em, and better go get 'em.

Still stand in the Land with the slugs in gun in my hand. Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy,Wish, and Flesh put it down to the north, south, east, and west. From back in the day, we claimin' the thuggish ruggish--no need to change it. Now everybody a thug. If you real, throw it up, but if it's fake, kill 'em and put 'em in with the rest of them phonies.

A brand new world for us-it's now or never

We'll change the rules for those native fools
Hail intervention-we're under one flag
'coz we are on the mission and we'll never go back

Now we're on the mission-the average man
is down on his knees,so he won't understand
Above the suspicion and fear of the law
we do what we do what it takes to continue the war
The mission's right over your head
""It's not what you think""-as it's always been said
No visible victims-we're very discrete
There's no turning back 'til the day when the mission's 
complete

""Hurry up and check the map,there must be something left""
Nobody's getting rich by moving slower
""Torch their towns,forget the clowns accusing us in theft""

Go on and on about yourself!

All about you
The more you speak, the less I care about you, you, you, you
It's not all about you
The world turns without you
The more you speak, the less I care about you, you, you
Whatever I do, you've already done
Only you've done it better and way before anyone.

You think that it's some game to win

You can come inside and wake me up, 
We'll pack and leave by dawn. We will pack and leave by dawn.

It's just our two poles knocking in the back seat, 
And your truck is doing fine today, and everything is fine. 

And your truck will climb up slowly, and we'll see how far we've gone, 
And the hills will stretch before us 
They are rolling on and on, they are rolling on and on. 

And the fish will look up at our boat, with envy and with fear, 
Because we will live forever, and our days are slow and dear, 
And our days are slow and dear.

I'm coiled up, so don't come near, And I get better every year. I age like a fine wine, People like me we're hard to find. You think I'm just buying time? Call me back when yo heads on right.

You got some ass but you got even more haters, and you askin me if I'm free later, So you must just love...elevators. To get to your level I'm parachuting. Stealin ya girl let's call it looting. You out there stressing I'm up in here coolin', We all know you're fake who you think you foolin'? Round-a-bout but I'm still turning, All I spit are spoken word sermons. Baptism, and the waters churning, But here in Hell, we stay burning. And I'm pent up like all day Cause I gotta get my mind in a new state, Been writing songs like it's my fate, And revealing myself, like lingerie. You look like children, catching fades, Swinging fists and pulling blades You only fight the wars that you wage. Why you so angry? I can't relate. (CHORUS) Yeah you know that I can't relate. You say ""Keep it Real"" but you so fake! Yeah you know that I can't relate. But this is the path that you chose to take. (CHORUS) The thing is, You're still there and I'm still here, And by this time of next year, I'll be the name that you all hear Still don't get it? I'll make it clear. I'm a meltdown, you're a single tear, I'm the whole head, you're just the ear. I'm the universe, you're the stratosphere. You're an anthill and I'm Mt. Rainier. I just talk tough because it's fun, But guess what boy, I ain't done. Nah this shit is just begun, You're fighting wars that I already won. We're not the same, so don't pretend Your words leave off where mine begin, Keep my style until the end, If it catches on, let's call it a trend. I ain't rich, and I'm unknown But stop talking about money, I don't like your tone. Look me in the eyes when you talking to me, Because you pay me respect, I don't want your money. I'm so down that I don't know what's up. But I don't drink so it's an empty cup. I sold my soul for a couple bucks, But I stole it back from the devil's clutch. But for real though mans, just do you, Cause uh, no one else wants to. Shit, I ain't mean to be rude. But call me Abe, cause I speak the truth. (CHORUS) Yeah you know that I can't relate. You say ""Keep it Real"" but you so fake! Yeah you know that I can't relate. But this is the path that you chose to take. (CHORUS) Yeah, see it's okay to be unique. If I wanted to be like you, I would be. I'm still just doing me, and man, I make it look easy.",Hip-Hop,Hip-Hop

And as I unzip her I just wish I didn't miss you this much
I'd rather take my chances riding this avalanche
If it means that I don't feel my bones are being crushed
That's when it seems
Like I'm stuck on the good years
How did I get here?
We're on repeat and we're going no where…yea
Why you fire up yourself go simmer down
Why you fire up yourself go simmer down
When you feel the freeze
Go simmer down
I've been spitting ammunition and missing the right conviction
And my bruise is feeling sore to the touch
I'd rather be diggin' than be bitching about how some shit
I'm in just makes it difficult to get the rush
That's when it seems
Like I'm stuck on the good years
How did I get here?

'Till I release this vengeance that I seek
Forgive You, the only thing
I wanna live, I'm ready to be free, to be free

Maybe you've been wounded too
Maybe all this is Your self protection
And all the hurts You thought were hidden
Are the ones now hurting me
So, who will make this patter end?

I find I can't get free
Till I release this vengeance that I seek

In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.

To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

"Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart 

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart 

I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion 

Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart 

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart 

I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love's glory

Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart",Jazz,Country

"I remember you
You're the one who made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago

I remember you
You're the one, who said, ""I love you too""
Didn't you know?

I remember too
A distant bell and stars that fell
Like rain out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall the thrill of them all
Then I will tell them, I remember you

I remember too
A distant bell and stars that fell
Like rain out of the blue, I miss you, darling

music by Ben Shepherd
Hey you slave, go hang your owners
Draw your names among their ashes
Put your children on their thrones
Gather â€˜round and fall right down
Here at sundown nothing is when
Everything is all right
Switch opens
Opening around and letâ€™s the garden rise
Switch is on
Hey, you patients
Whereâ€™s your surgeon
Left with your
Insides open
Hung your hearts out
On the table
Gather â€˜round and fall right down
Feel the air now
Stumbling and wander in the moonshine

"You said, ""If I ask you a question,
Are you gonna lie to me?""
I said, ""honey, is that your question?
'cause honey, that one's easy""
'cause half the truth is, just how much there is
The kids don't get it
No. The kids don't get it

I'm gonna be an expert stranger,
Better than the giant squid
I'm gonna leave the stranger experts
Scratching their heads, saying, ""How'd he do it?!""
When half the truth is, just how hard it is
But the kids don't get it
No. The kids won't get it

I'll be the antlers and I'll be the elk
I'll be the right whale and I'll be parallel
The kids don't get it
That's right, kids don't get it

I'll feel more than human when the work's hitting home
I'll be aped by my ancestors. I'll state the plan as my own
I'll be gripping the city, I'll be hitting the town
You'll say. ""I'd be hurt if you didn't, when I come around""
That's right, kids don't get it

I'll be as careless as you are certain.
I'll get outta my own way
I'll stop to cry into the curtains
And like the greats, before me, go on stage
And if half-true its, good enough for this
'Cause the kids don't get it
No. The kids don't get it
If I ask you a question,
Ya gonna lie to me?
Ah honey is that your question?
'Cause that one's easy

"Two ravens in the old oak tree, one for you and one for me
Bluebells in the late December, I see signs now all the time
The last time we slept together, there was something that was not there
You never wanted to alarm me but I'm the one that's drowning now

I could sleep forever these days because in my dreams I see you again
But this time fleshed out fuller face in your confirmation dress
It was so like you to visit me to let me know you were OK
It was so like you to visit me, always worrying about someone else

At your funeral I was so upset, so upset,
In your life you were larger than this
Statuesque

I see signs now all the time that your not dead your sleeping
I believe in anything that brings you back home to me",Rock,Country

All the blood, sweat, and tears getting ready
For this one moment, for this one shot
All eyes are focused on you
Everyone is now watching, waiting
It seems the world has stopped turning
The clock's spinning, and you better not blow it

Your personal ""come to Jesus"" moment
Where they separate winners and losers
Ask yourself; do I really want this bad enough?
I've got to prove myself

I'll set this place on fire

Each one just waiting for you to wash out
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity

Seize everything you've ever wanted

Tells me that you are my own.

Babylon Breathe Babylon
I see you people babylon and on and on
Graven images, golden idols and false icons
I'm seeking wisdom like Solomon
But my antenae keeps on picking up evil transmissions
At headquarters I receive my mission
Blow up the ruler of the air like nuclear fission
So I analyze my weapons, laser guided rifles that shoot spiritual wisdom
I think I see enemy warriors,
Fragile heathens tryin' to run stuff like mayors
So with brotha's that snuff punks,
I set up time bombs to destroy the strong holds of Babylon

Decadent culture make you forget your spiritual priority
Back down by the movement, soldiers who will serve ya
Open to be used by God, destroy you like Medo-Persia
Jewel of all kingdoms, live evil, purified Hurrah take you down
Don't look back, overthrown you like Sodom and Gomorrah arm of the law
Guilty of all crimes I be like the great Prophet Isiah
Predict your fall over 150 times, got rhymes you could never use
For the purpose you be using, I'll dance over your fields
Present day Iraq still lies in ruins lies,
Schemes, backstab persuasions bumrushed
Get crushed by us, this rescue invasion

There waiting for a ride.
Stood all alone so far from home,
He beckons her inside.
A smile that has two meanings 
Slips his fat hand to her knee,
But swiftly learns how quick to turn this woman scorned can be.

Her flesh was all he wanted 
But his blood was what she got,
And did he dream of scenes x-rated
When she showed him Salem's lot?
Now the hunted is the hunter
With a heart as cold as steel,
See the empty rear view mirror showing
Catherine at the wheel.

Down in the park just after dark,
Girl crying 'neath a tree.
Begs ""Can you help please mister? mummy left and forgot me.""
""My, you're out late my dear"" exclaims the shabby, strange old man,
Who hidden in the bushes finds a lion in his lamb.

She's a killer with a conscience
And a bite too sharp to feel,
This child sat on the roundabout is Catherine at the wheel.

And if you could you'd kill them twice
How sweet revenge can be,
'Gainst those you've sent to that place with no fury next to thee.

Her flesh was all they wanted
But their blood was what she got,
And did they dream of scenes x-rated
When she showed them Salem's lot?
She's a killer with a conscience
And a heart as cold as steel,

Any hour of the working day
She'd send me in the corn field mid afternoon
Said son its all part of your job

That I would kick if I was given the chance
Never was amused by the kindness I used
I was whipped in the barn until dawn
It hurt me

Were gonna make a stand and burn down your farm

When I first wandered down into town
I was both proud and shy,
As I felt every eye.
And in every shop window
I'd primp, passing by.
At all manner of fashion I'd frown,
And the world seemed to smile all around.
Till it wilted, I wore it.
I'll always adore it;
My sweet little Alice blue gown.
At all manner of fashion I'd frown,
And the world seemed to smile all around.
Till it wilted, I wore it.
I'll always adore it;

"These eyes they will gaze and reflect
And gauge every thought I reject
No sway of stance in changing times
Just a narrow mind commanding respect
We stand on the words of the wise
And languish every call to despise
We know the hollow wound of their lies
(Pre-chorus:)
No reformed edition
Never losing vision
Now into forever
Only getting better
Ways of now, spiral down
How much more we allow
(Chorus:)
Keeping sight of the vow we made
Holding fast to the hope
So when we stand in the line of wrath
The true and righteous will know
The foundation that we used to uphold
Now regarded as the madness of old
Every alteration made to the standard of truth
Is a nail in the coffin we hold
We embody everything they despise
Because they see us through degenerate eyes
So when thay cast you down as intolerant filth
Stand firm, never bow to the lies
(Pre-chorus)
(Chorus)
See the scorn inside my eyes
(Chorus)",Metal,Metal
"There's nothing I hate more, than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises, and all there plastic deals
They just can't be themselves, and live their own lives out
They're just an imitation of what life's all about

""Because of me you are who you are
So sign your name and you'll go for
I'm your friend, I think you should
So sign your name, it's for your own good""
How many times have you heard this today???
Some bogus piss-on saying ""let's do lunch babe""
For them this bullshit, that's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
Imitation of life

Oh, oh, oh
Anger burns
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend

""Take my advice, and listen to me
A great opportunity, can't you see
I only want what's best for you
The deal of a lifetime, what more can I do""
How many times have you heard this today?
Some stupid sucker says ""it's great, we love ya babe""
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
Imitation of life

Oh, oh, oh
Anger burns
Bands dress like women with hairspray and lace
I'd pass an image law, stick it in your face!
Let's see how long they keep dressing this way
Wearing this image twenty four hours a day!

Did you ever think for yourself??
Just once, did you ever think??
That's all I want to know

Imitation of life, living out a lie
You'll never be right, imitation of life
Why are you here??, you're taking up my space
The new imperfect race, imitation of life

Oh, oh, oh

Anger burns
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had a unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend
There's nothing I hate more
Than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises
And all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves
And live their own lives out
They're just an imitation
Of what life's all about

"(This story was told to me by Jerry Clover at the 1971 discjockey convention
I told Jerry I's gonna write a song about it
My brother Hillman gonna play the cigarette paper and the comb play)
[ paper & comb ]
Coot Marseilles was an old black man from down Mississippi way
He worked out in the white man's yard and he loved to sing and play
Ol' Coot worked hard God rest his soul he never was much to roam
His entire band was an old guitar a cigarette paper and a comb
[ paper & comb ]
Now ol' Coot had one song that he would sing when his long days were put in
There ain't nobody knows that song now cause I reckon that it died with him
His songs were made up 'o dry bones from pain and sweat and tears
And Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy was sometimes all you'd hear
Now on Saturdays ol' Coot didn't work much 'cepten he built a fire in the stove
And when he get through he'd mosey on down and sit by the gravel road
He'd hum that song as he walked along with the faraway look in his eyes
And he sat there by the road all day watched them fine Ford cars go by
Now on Saturday night the white folks danced and ol' Coot he'd pick and sing
He had an old RC bottle neck that he'd slide up and down them strings
Now Coot didn't care much for lyrics he just made 'em up as he went along
And Lord I wish they had tape back then cause I'd sure love to hear them songs
Well his clothes were old and his hair was gray and hard work had bent his back
His songs were never recognized by statuettes or flags
His songs were all about the working man and Coot never owned a tie
The only thing he ever really had to do was die
[ paper & comb ]
Now ol' Coot's gone and maybe I'm wrong to bring it all back again
But I know his friends down in Mississippi sure thought a lot of him
So rock on Coot and enjoy your rest your long day's work is done
And if they got Fords up in Heaven sir I sure hope you're driving one

Yourself into a hole

Because you lost control

Needs before I go
Your trails of debt and soaking wet cotton
It's a pain that you'll never know

I will forgive your rotten

The shame we've spread

By circumstance alone
There's no need to soften
I'll keep your lovely note
And let go of all these decisions
Remember what you know
You will never be alone

And love in my heart all for you.",Jazz,Jazz

"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there
She would merengue and do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star, Tony always tended bar
Across a crowded floor, they worked from eight til four
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?

The hottest spot north of Havana
At the Copa, Copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the Copa..
they fell in love
His name was Rico, he wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancin' there
And when she finished, he called her over
But Rico went a bit too far, Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gun shot
But just who shot who?

The hottest spot north of Havana

she lost her love
Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl
But that was thirty years ago, when they used to have a show
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola
Still in the dress she used to wear, faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined, and drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind!

Tied to the artery

"Dear sir I write this note to you to tell me of me plight, And at the time of writing, I am not a pretty sight. Me body is all black and blue, me face a deathly gray. And I write this note to say, why Paddy's not at work today. While working on the fourteenth floor some bricks I had to clear. Now to throw them down from such a height, was not a good idea. The foreman wasn't very pleased, he being an awkward sod. He said I'd have to carry them down the ladders in me hod. Now, clearing all these bricks by hand, it was so very slow. So I hoisted up a barrel, and secured the rope below. But in me haste to do the job, I was too blind to see; That a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me. So when I untied the rope, the barrel fell like lead. And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead. While I shot up like a rocket, to my dismay I found, That halfway up, I met the bloody barrel coming down. Well, the barrel broke my shoulders as to the ground it sped, And when I reached the top, I banged the pulley with me head. Well I clung on tight though numb and shock from this almighty blow, And the barrel spilled out half the bricks fourteen floors below. Now, when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor, I then outweighed the barrel, and so started down once more. Still clinging tightly to the rope, I sped towards the ground. And I landed on the broken bricks that were all scattered 'round. While I lay their groaning on the ground I thought I passed the worst, When the barrel hit the pulley wheel, and then the bottom burst. Well a shower of bricks rained down on me - I hadn't got a hope. As I lay there moaning on the ground: I let go of the bloody rope. The barrel then being heavier it started down once more, And landed right across me as I lay across the floor. Well it broke three ribs, and my left arm, and I can only say; That I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today.",Folk,Folk
"Don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
You can't lose a broken heart

If you ever break up
Then try to make up
It's tough to make a brand new start

Take a walk
Think it over
While strolling beneath the moon
Don't say things in December
You'll regret in June

Ware your remark
Before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon,
Don't be erratic 
Be diplomatic
To keep your heart's in tune

Cruel harsh words
Often spoken
Will upset your applecart
So don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
Because you can't lose a broken heart
No, you can't lose a broken heart",Jazz,Indie

I look up at your face
The man in the hand-painted photograph
I know you from someplace

What comes so hard from history
Comes so easy to my pen

And I keep signing your name
While the world stays the same around you
I keep signing your name
Is that all that remains of us?

Year after year in the shrinking walls
Nothing to the exchange
Wood in the smiles at the holidays
And your kiss that fit me strange

What comes so hard from history
Comes so easy to my pen

And I keep signing your name
While the world stays the same around you
I keep signing your name
Is that all that remains of us?

You gave the truth to the lie, turned your eyes to the sky
Looked away when I looked your way
There's a myth in the air, it's too late to repair
But you look at me anyway

Now where the kiss and the smile would be
The distance lies instead
Nine hundred miles of what might have been
And a world of things much better left unsaid

And I keep signing your name
While the world stays the same around you
I keep signing your name
Is that all that remains of us?

When the heart's tired of running

When the match won't light so the flames don't tremble

and a friend for life
And I'm hoping it might be you
When I think of life as a chance not taken
Or as a compromise tinged with regret
When the kids leave for breeding and the Tv's king
Will you tell me we're not done yet?
Will you think of me as a distant island
Or will you come with me to the moon?
I'll need a soulmate to hold me
and a friend for life
And I'm hoping it might be you
Give me asylum and I'll keep the faith
Keep me in coffee and so safe
And I'll feed your cats and I'll paint walls
And I'll be your one night stand
Will you come with me in the certain knowledge
That the catch is there's no catch at all?

I was walking down Hasting Street
Everybody was talkin' about, Henry Swing Club
I decided to stop in there for awhile
And man, when I got there
Yeah, they were really havin' a ball
Sings:
Well, I feel so good
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Well, to the break of day
(Say, it again)
Well, I feel so good
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Well, to the break of day
(Alright)
When I was a young boy
I was layin' down one night
And I heard ma and pa talkin'
I heard pa tell ma
""Hey, come on, let that boy boogie-woogie
'Cause you know it's in him
And it's just got to come out""
'Cause it's in him
And it's just got to come out
Well, feels so good, child
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Lord, 'til the break-a day
(Chillen, I'm chillen here)
Well, feels so good, now Lord
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Yeah-ow, 'til the break of day.",Rock,Rock
"After the music had stopped, I still heard it playing 
I moved a little closer to hear the words she was saying 
She said, ""I'll never break your heart 
I'd never try to fake it
My love is here for you all you have to do is take it"" 
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl so fine 

The night seemed to say it was right but could I believe her? 
My heart said, ""it's time to go"" 
But my eyes wouldn't leave her 
There's always something trying to break your heart 
Somebody trying to take it 
My little girl tries so hard to help me make it 
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl so fine 
Whoa whoa so fine
Whoa whoa so fine

When we danced I forgot everything 
And whispered, ""hold me tight""
Take a chance on what tomorrow brings 
Won't you be mine, be mine, be mine tonight?
We walked away laughing together 
Into the night forever and ever and ever 

Now, I know I'll never break my baby's heart 
I'll never try to fake it 
I'll give her all my love all she has to do is take it 
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl so fine
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl so fine
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl, my little girl, yea
My little girl so fine
Whoa whoa so fine, my baby
Whoa whoa so fine, my baby",Rock,R&B

For showing me that you're mine
But it saved my life
Saved my life

Now if anybody dies before I'm back
See me laughing through those tears

Doin' it to myself
Just leave these things alone

There is a war inside
Between my spirit and mind
I sit here wondering
""Why oh why?""

Emotions on the loose
I know what's right
But it's often the wrong I choose

Shoulda done it your way, but just like a child
I'm losing my direction, I need You to guide me
Turn me into someone that's faithful and true
Give me the strength to live my life for You

Tell me why I do what I don't wanna do
And I don't do what I wanna do
Tell me why I do what I don't wanna do

I live a double life
Sometimes I compromise
I feel ashamed of the way
My heart looks inside

And though I long to obey
Sometimes I drift away
And take for granted
Your never-ending grace

Help me to remember your love for me
Take me to the river, wash me in Your mercy
You're the Father of forgiveness, time after time
But still there's something messing with my mind

Tell me why I do what I don't wanna do
And I don't do what I wanna do

In a one-horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh,
Oer the fields we go,
Laughing all the way.

Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

"(INTRO) The following program deals with controversial subjects, and due to it's explicit nature, parental guidence is strongly advised. The theorys, opinions, and beliefs expressed are not the only possible interpretations. The viewer is invited to make a judgement based on all alvailable information. Most people agree that evil exsists in this world, for some it's war, famine, or violence. For some it's a spiratual ____?___, and for other's, evil is a very real presence, a physical entity, of terrifying power. What is evil? Is it mearly a dictionary definition for wrong or bad, or is it something more, a deeper, darker force that makes people perform cruel or inhuman acts. Does an evil force really exsist that can attract and then control the actions of human beings, or is evil nothing more than a convenient excuse for deviant and destructive behavior. These are questions without easy answer's and are continually debated by those who study the human mind and the human sprirt. (5 or 6 dudes debating evil)",Hip-Hop,Electronic
"Infected by our callous acts. Our blood flows the kiss of death. Relentless disease as death tolls rise. This virus breeds on human desire. Whether you lust the needle of the flesh, you've sealed your fate, a fate of death. Kiss of death. Our blood flows the kiss of death. The eliminator, taker of life. An epidemic we feed and supply. Kiss of death. Now frail bodies are no longer immune. No retribution, no cure to save you. Consequence for our acts. Kiss of death.",Metal,Electronic

Roll out of bed but I'm never quite alone

And all these problems use me as a rope
Sometimes the pressure will just drive me crazy
At any time I could explode
I need some piece of mind, its got me tired
Don't wanna lose it, but I'm turning down that road
I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our lives
Work's hard, the day's too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time
I sit in traffic every single morning
Just as I arrive, I'm slaving to the grind
Making the money so I feed my family
But I can't raise them, 'cause I ain't got the time
I got no free days on my busy schedule
I turn the page and it's the same
Don't like my situation, you don't either
Don't wanna look back scared of working life away

We all need a moment in our lives
Work's hard, the day's too long
And thats just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time
But every now and then
I drive alone
An open road
Hot summer days
A gentle breeze that feels alright
Home alone
And I can't feel the pain
Only strain
Enjoy the sights
I feel alive
When actually here just feels alright
Far from home

Or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand
The world becomes a wonderland

Those rainbows when there is no rain?

These things that happen

"Children, Broadripple is burning
And the girls are getting sick
Off huffing glue up in the bathroom
While your boyfriends pick up chicks
And darling I'm lost
I heard you whispering
That night in fountain square
The trashed filled streets made me wish we were heading home

There was love inside the basement
Where that woman used to lie
In a sleeping bag we shared upon
The floor most every night
And darling I'm drunk,
And everything that I have loved has turned to stone
So pack your bags and come back home

And I'm wasted
You can taste it
Don't look at me that way,
'Cause I'll be hanging from a rope
I will haunt you like a ghost

And if my woman was a fire,
She'd burn out before I wake,
And be replaced by pints of whiskey,
Cigarettes, and outer space
Then somebody moves
And everything you thought you had will go to shit
Well, we've got a lot
Don't ever forget that

And I wrote this on airplane where the people looked like eggs
And when a woman that you loved was gone,
She was bombing East Japan
And don't fucking move,
'Cause everything you thought you had will go to shit
We've got a lot
Don't you dare forget that

And I'm wasted

Don't look at me that way,

"Standing in the ruins
Of another Black man's life,
Or flying through the valley
He's separating day and night.
""I am death,"" cried the Vulture.
""For the people of the light.""

Charon brought his raft
From the sea that sails on souls,
And saw the scavenger departing,
Taking warm hearts to the cold.
He knew the ghetto was the haven
For the meanest creature ever known.

In a wilderness of heartbreak
And a desert of despair,
Evil's clarion of justice
Shrieks a cry of naked terror.

Taking babies from their mamas
And leaving grief beyond compare.

So if you see the Vulture coming,
Flying circles in your mind,
Remember there is no escaping
For he will follow close behind.
Only promised me a battle,
Battle for your soul and mine.

And he's leaving

"(Dolly Parton) Raindrops tumble to the ground Making puddles all around Drops of rain that look like tears Fall on my window pane Raindrops seem to harmonize With teardrops falling from my eyes And my tears keep falling down As steady as the rain Steady as the rain they fall Tears that just won't dry at all Tears that cannot wash away the pain Sometimes without knowing it I touch my face and find it wet And my tears keep falling down As steady as the rain I can't face the fact that I am not important in your life Once you lived for rollin' me And then your feelings changed There's just no gettin' over you I try so hard, but it's no use And my tears keep falling down As steady as the rain Raindrops just keep falling down Beatin' out their rhythmic sounds Dancin' as they play their sweet refrain Memories of you cloud my mind Cloud my eyes and I start cryin' And my tears keep falling down As steady as the rain As steady as the rain Steady as the rain they fall Tears that just won't dry at all Tears that just won't wash away the pain Memories of you cloud my mind Cloud my eyes and I start cryin' And my tears keep falling down As steady as the rain As steady as the rain",Country,Country
"The last song
The light that's in your eyes, like everyone wants it to be
Well can't you see that it must be this way
Who knows who's wrong or right
Just as long as you're here tonight
Just like my mother, always taking my likings away
When nobody's watching us

I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there too long
I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there

I miss the love, I miss the holidays
I miss my best friend, cheap cigars, stupid kids and movie stars
And just like my father, always taking my likings away
When nobody's watching us

I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there too long
I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there too long

Why does it feel like this world is just not for us
Why does it feel like this world's all they've got for us
Why does it feel like nobody's watching us

I missed her sweet smell, I miss it everyday
I miss my best friend, cheap cigars, stupid kids and moviestars
And I missed the last song and I miss you
And this time this one's for us

I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there too long

When I am through with toil and care
I'll leave this world of sin's hand
And see my Savior over there

Well look up, look up and sing God's praise

Oh, we'll rise to meet Him in the sky
We'll see our Savior by and by

"[Ne-Yo] Oh, hey! [Game] Picture me and my gangsta girl, Riding with the top back. Banging Ne-Yo, my neck free yo, My SOX hat, Tilted to the side Like you know I get my grind on. Get my shine on. Jewelry Black in all rhinestones. Rims spinning like a globe, On these low pros. Do it big cause I'm supposed to floss, And that's the reason she break me off. Cause I'm gangsta, And I'm riding with [Ne-Yo] Ne-Yo, it's a thug and a gentleman. Rollin like a boss through, No matter the cost too, Kept trying to brag, what? Money not a issue. Don't let your girl see us. That might make her diss you. Cause if she roll wit us, She wont even miss you. [Game] Pop rubber bands when I throw a stack, Before it hit the ground she throw it back. When I make it rain that's chump change, That pay for the 26 On my range range range drive drive, Take the wheel while I roll and slide, Climb over to the passenger side and freeze. [Chorus: Ne-Yo] And once again it's on, You should take a picture With your camera phone. Player she not coming home, And if I'm on her screen saver, That, that mean later we gone. If I let her take a picture, She gonna roll wit me. If I let her take a picture, She gonna roll wit me. If I let her take a picture She gonna roll wit me, Gonna roll wit me, Gonna roll wit me. [Game] If you don't know by now baby I'm a star, Look at my face, Look at my car, Look at my waist then look at my scars. Look out da window see where we are. In my phantom, in my rover, banging [Ne-Yo] Ne-Yo, it's a thug and a gentleman. She ain't never rolled in a car with the suicide, Girl when it's you and I, they committing suicide. All of them want, my girl. Cause she pretty and thick in the thighs. Homie don't mastermind, Do a song wit suicide. [Game] She call me Jay, I call her B, We getting married, to the streets. I'm chasing money, she chasing me. I'm right where I wanna be, With the B on my Bentley, The horse on my Lambo, Crown on my Cadillac, Checks on my air max. Haters, better fall back, Before I put something in your ball cap. That's my chick, I got her back like a bra strap. Cause she fine and she cute, She think she all that, and she all that. That's my girl that's my world, [Chorus] Game can you take a picture? Ne-Yo can you t 75e take a picture? We've been waiting all night, Just to take a picture wit you. Game can you take a picture? Ne-Yo can you take a picture? We've been waiting all night, Just to take a picture wit you. [Game] Grab the wheel take control, And let your hair blow inside my Lambo. Pull out ya phone, picture that. Take it home let ya man know I'm hitting that. While I'm hitting that, She send it back, She drop it low, We about to blow. Me and N-E-dash-Y-O yo girl know. She so Ciara, So eve, So Mariah, So Be, She so Trina, I'm R. Kelly, She remind me of my goldies. I'm cooly high, I'm cochi, She a 34 D, I'm so pleased. I'm so so def, she so Janet, I'm JD and she full of me. In the H2 we fold Deep through the NYC off no sleep. I hate to drive but I break it wide, When I'm riding with my shorty. I'd kidnap her and never take her home, Riding off banging Ne-yo sitting on chrome, In that Maserati, see the paparazzi, They... She gone. [Chorus]",Hip-Hop,Hip-Hop

"When my feet were in shackles
And my hands were in chains
You took my mind and made it settle
In a land so far away

When I was toiling in the fields (yeah)
You made me push on through
Yes I'm head over heels,
Over heels in love with you
Yes I'm head over heels,
Over heels in love with you

When I was in the womb
You made me wanna see this world
Every setting of the moon
I dreamt of you being my girl

Say ooh I can't deny
Without you I would be dead
And the day that I die
I die with you in my head,
Yes the day that I die
I die with you in my head,
In my head in my head

There's just no get away
When you're dancing in my brain
When I'm cruising on your waves
Coulda never go astray (ooh)

Everything is music
I just put parts in a frame
To capture this very moment
And never let it go away
They use you and abuse you
And treat you like a thing
Forever I'll be faithful
Have your back until the end
Forever I'll be faithful
Have your back until the end

There's just no get away
When you're dancing in my brain
When I'm cruising on your waves
Coulda never go astray (ooh)

Got a ticket for my destination
On a tour of one-night stands
My suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band

'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see
Reminds me that I long to be

To tell you the way that I feel
Cause I found a love that's so real
And I've been searching all my life
For someone to show me the way
Then you turned my night into day
I see clearly now, my arms are open wide
And I'm gonna make it through with you here by my side

Until the rivers have all run dry
There'll always be love in this heart of mine
Forever true (always for you)
As long as the world keeps turning round
I'll always be thankful for what I've found
I'll never let the sun go down
I'll keep shining through
Always for you
Drifting on a lonely sea
Without a friend in the world
Then you were the voice that I heard
And when your arms reached out for me
You made me feel like I belong
You gave me the strength to go on
You are my hope, my prayer, when things are going rough
You always give me the miracle of love

Your heart might cry
Yes she might even catch my eye
But no one compares

There's a happy city, they say
Where the people are grand and time is planned
So it's Christmas everyday

'Neath the scotch and soda fountain
There's a treat in store for us guys
Under cigarette trees, we'll take our ease
While the cops fan off the flies

There you will be a lucky sinner
With no conscience for your guide
Each horse you pick will be a winner
And the doors of every bank are open wide

Far across Tomorrow Mountain
There's a life that's fancy and free
On a platinum street we'll plant our feet
It's the land that's fair to see
Won't you hurry there with me'

Just across Tomorrow Mountain
Every girl is Queen of the May
And the kitchens, I'm told are lined with gold
And there ain't no bills to pay

Can't you cross that distant mountain
Where it rains Chanel No.5
And the gutters, I think are paved with mink
And the diamond bushes thrive

Pigs trot around already roasted
Won't you have a slice of ham'
Marshmallows bloom, already toasted
And the clouds are made of marmalade and jam

Can't you see Tomorrow Mountain'
Can't you watch it glimmer and glow'
It's a wonderful town that's upside down
And it's full of easy dough
Won't you pack your bags and go'",Jazz,Folk

And don't let me fall, 'cause I can only give my all

And nothing else matters now, with all we've been through

I appreciate that

Just trying to get the horse out the stable
Was once part of a dynasty, well least I was trying to be
Think it was the time when I was finding me
Sitting in the spot with the dimes willing to do anything to be a bad boy at the time
Then I rolled the dices nah the money didn't add up 
But just that whole experience it was priceless
No free rides to the bank on top of that was the untimely demise of Frank (BI)
Then the No Way Out Tour we was smoking outdoor spent 80 stacks on C LO that without tour
Videotape it all I still watch it, now travel the world learn how to rock a crowd
It ain't much but it beats poor Things that I been through is all I can speak for

[Chorus: Luther]
I can only speak for the things that I been through
I can only speak for the things that I been through

Now I'm on Ruff Ryder Interscope same shit Partnership Joint Venture 50/50 same split
Jimmy put the money up two singles off of we are the streets 
Then after that seem like he was done with us but it wasn't over yet
Styles had a plan from the jump which was to come out with my solo next
Things a little better these the niggas that I been doing it with forever so I'm like whatever
First album dropped promotion was hella Every stage I rocked performance was stella
Had the whole world ready to ride or die for me and I wasn't platinum I was just side money
X was bringing the mulla I was in the hood in the kitchen with the digital ruler
I can't tell bout the evil me do, I can only speak for the things that I been through

I can only speak for the things that I been through
I can only speak for the things that I been through

As far as the LOX we all fine cellar is all wine
Selfish for me to say Roc Fella is all mine cause it ain't
I'm just a another employee that's on line trying to get my act together and do it one more time
Twenty-one gunz salute with all nines and I know it's on me to make sure we all shine (Gotta)
Fall Back let the weed contact your mind, 
Confined all bull shit in any contract you sign
If you from the streets though it's plenty of loop holes to eat
Yo once they let you in your suppose to keep doe
But I can't give you the formula I'm on it though
Expect the worst the outcome is enormous though stay humble 
Still keep your heat for insurance though

Every night they're dancin', on those marble floors

Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now
Taking a chance on love

Here I slip again
About to take that tip again
Got my grip again
Taking a chance on love

Now I prove again
That I can make life move again
In the grove again
Taking a chance on love

I walk around with a horseshoe
In clover I lie
And, brother rabbit, of course you
Better kiss your foot goodbye

On the ball again
I'm riding for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again
Taking a chance on love",Jazz,Jazz

"Are you a stranger to God
Carried away with your pride 
Tell me sinner did you ever step to think 
Are you afraid to die 
 
Are you afraid 
Are you unsaved 
Are you afraid to die 

Call on him while he's near
Moments are swift passing by
Will you seek him where he may be found 

Are you afraid to die 
Are you too wicked to cry 
Would you to God's bosom fly 
Soon he's coming like a thief in the night
Are you afraid to die",Folk,Country

replaying every line
remembering all of the love we made
you told me only yesterday
nothing could take your love away
here in this room so many traces of you
so many nights lying by your side
sleeping with secrets deep inside
secrets your eyes could not deny
come as you are
lay with me
beautiful lies once more tell me
with all the love in my heart
i'll set you free
now that your eyes have said good-bye
i found joy so pure
my heart secure
with the love the two of us would share
and though it all seems so unfair
no one's to blame when love's not there
my whole life has changed
feels like i'll surely go insane
'cause my world revolved 'round
a love that never was
before i say good-bye to love
just hold me until the morning comes
come as you are stay with me
kiss me once more before you leave

On a moonless summer night

In a house across town 
She's pacin' by the telephone 
In her faded flannel gown 
Askin' for miracle 
Hopin' she's not right 
Prayin' it's the weather 
That's kept him out all night 
And the thunder rolls

Another love grows cold 
On a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on 
Out of control 
Deep in her heart 
The thunder rolls 

She's waitin' by the window 
When he pulls into the drive 
She rushes out to hold him 
Thankful he's alive 
But on the wind and rain 
A strange new perfume blows 
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes 
And he knows that she knows 
And the thunder rolls

The lines are clear with tomorrow standing against me And I am silent as I face my fears alone Responsibility weighing down upon my shoulders When all that I needed in a heartbeat is taken from me The truth is unclear if you close your eyes too tightly What dream is life spun like silver to the night Don't wake me up and do not let me go And if the world falls from the sky Shall we like the atlas rise If time collapses to this end Beneath the avalanche With love like pages stripped away My heart must find another way Courage comes from circumstance Beneath the avalanche And I fear the sky is falling It's the price we pay if we act with our convictions But the faces I see still believe me too naive We are not lost or forgotten to our conscience When all that we need for survival we carry inside I will not fall before you I will not grovel at your feet I will not let you crush me My will is stronger than you think,Electronic,Indie

Far away, far away
A song that's fading

Put me on a plane tomorrow
I'll try to run from all my sorrow
Far away, far away
From endless waiting

It's so cold here without my sun
I'm so sad here, far away from everyone
What a fool to be ambitious
Moving here with all of my wishes
Far away, far away
From where my heart is

Shut the phone off and pack my bags
No more boys who boast and brag
Far away, far away
Where I belong

I'm so sorry for some things I've done
I'll be lonely till I can see my only one

He was just a fool and that's all he'd ever be just a fool
That's all he'd ever be and there's nothing beautiful in

Me we were shaken from the branch, fallen from the tree
And we were not quite sure just what we had seen so we
Climbed up really high and tried hard to see and there
Were many people many things that looked just like you

Lighting up your living room high on the mantle
I could bring some romance without any scandal

Putting your groceries away and washing your dishes
I could float around your tongue and ease the tension
And then when you were done you'd just quiet down

Will the magic fade?
Would I turn you off or away?
If I pull you in
Would I push you out

I wish I was a sweater wrapped around your hips
And when it got too cold into me you'd slip
And when the sun came back you would hang me up
And I would watch you while you undress

Will the magic fade?
Would I turn you off or away?
If I pull you in
